"This guide provides a reference about the |sci| interface of |gf|. For a "
"complete reference of |gf|, please report to the `specific guides`_, but "
"you should be able to use the scilab interface without any particular "
"knowledge of the |gf| internals, although a basic knowledge about Finite "
"Elements is required. This documentation is however not self contained. "

"more extensive description of the structures algorithms and concepts "
