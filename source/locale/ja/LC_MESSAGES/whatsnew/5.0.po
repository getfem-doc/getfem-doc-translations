"This is a major release of |gf|. The main evolution is the generalization"
" of the use of the high-level generic assembly for a more easy writting "
"of nonlinear coupled problems. The few incompatibilities come from the "
"fact that a certain number of tools have been re-designed (mainly "
"Nitsche's bricks and time integration schemes) and the old brick system "
"(from 1.7 release) have been definitevely unplugged."
