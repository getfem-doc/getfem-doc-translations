msgid "where ``mf`` is a variable of type |gf_mf|, ``U`` is a vector which represent the field to be convected, ``mf_v`` is a |gf_mf| for the velocity field, ``V`` is the dof vector for the velocity field, ``dt`` is the pseudo time of convection and ``nt`` the number of iterations for the computation of characteristics. ``option`` is an option for the boundary condition where there is a re-entrant convection. The possibilities are getfem::CONVECT_EXTRAPOLATION (extrapolation of the field on the nearest element) or getfem::CONVECT_UNCHANGED (no change of the value on the boundary)."
