msgid "An important issue of this model is that it is subjected to the so called shear locking so that a direct Galerkin procedure do not give a satisfactory approximation. There is several ways to circumvent the shear locking problem : reduced integration, projection of the transverse shear term, mixed methods. The two first method are proposed."

The most popular element of this type is the MITC4 which correspond to the quadrilateral element Q1 with a projection of the transverse shear term on a rotated Raviart-Thomas element of lowest degree (RT0) (see [ba-dv1985]_, [br-ba-fo1989]_).

Note that since this brick uses the weak form language, the parameter can be regular expression of this language. There are three variants. `variant = 0` corresponds to the an unreduced formulation and in that case only the integration method `mim` is used. Practically this variant is not usable since it is subject to a strong locking phenomenon. `variant = 1` corresponds to a reduced integration where `mim` is used for the rotation term and `mim_reduced` for the transverse shear term. `variant = 2` (default) corresponds to the projection onto a rotated RT0 element of the transverse shear term. For the moment, this is adapted to quadrilateral only (because it is not sufficient to remove the locking phenomenon on triangle elements). Note also that if you use high order elements, the projection on RT0 will reduce the order of the approximation. Returns the brick index in the model."
