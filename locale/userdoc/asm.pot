For example, with linear geometric transformations, if ``mfu`` is a :math:`P_{K}` FEM, and ``mfd`` is a :math:`P_{L}` FEM, the integration will have to be chosen of order :math:`\\geq 2(K-1) + L`, since the elementary integrals computed during the assembly of ``SM`` are :math:`\\int\\nabla\\varphi_i\\nabla\\varphi_j\\psi_k` (with :math:`\\varphi_i` the basis functions for ``mfu`` and :math:`\\psi_i` the basis functions for ``mfd``)."
