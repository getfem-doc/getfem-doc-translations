msgid "where ``md``is the model object, ``mim`` is the integration method, ``varname`` is the variable of the model for which the source term is added, ``dataexpr`` has to be  a regular expression of the weak form language (except for the complex version where it has to be a declared data of the model). It has to be scalar or vector valued depending on the fact that the variable is scalar or vector valued itself. ``region`` is a mesh region on which the term is added. If the region corresponds to a boundary, the source term will represent a Neumann condition. ``directdataname`` is an optional additional data which will directly be added to the right hand side without assembly."
