msgid "Although it will be more convenient to build a specific solver for some problems, a generic solver is available to test your models quickly. It can also be taken as an example to build your own solver. It is defined in :file:`src/getfem/getfem_model_solvers.h` and :file:`src/getfem_model_solvers.cc` and the call is::"

msgid "Note that |sLU| is used as a default linear solver on \"small\" problems. You can also link |mumps| with |gf| (see section :ref:`ud-linalg`) and use the parallel version. For nonlinear problems, A Newton method (also called Newton-Raphson method) is used."
