The general form is :math:`\\int \\partial_n u(x)v(x) = \\int r(x)v(x) \\forall v` where :math:`r(x)` is the right hand side for the Dirichlet condition (0 for homogeneous conditions) and :math:`v` is in a space of multipliers defined by the variable `multname` (first version) or defined on the finite element method `mf_mult` (second version) or simply on a Lagrange finite element method of degree `degree` (third version) on the part of boundary determined by `region`. `dataname` is an optional parameter which represents the right hand side of the Dirichlet condition. If `R_must_be_derivated` is set to `true` then the normal derivative of `dataname` is considered."
