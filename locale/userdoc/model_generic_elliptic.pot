msgid "where :math:`a` is the coefficient and :math:`u` the variable. The coefficient can be a scalar, a matrix or an order four tensor. The variable can be vector valued or not. This means that the brick treats several different situations. If the coefficient is a scalar or a matrix and the variable is vector valued then the term is added componentwise. An order four tensor coefficient is allowed for vector valued variable only.  The coefficient can be constant or described on a FEM. Of course, when the coefficient is a tensor described on a finite element method (a tensor field) the corresponding data can be a huge vector. The components of the matrix/tensor have to be stored with the fortran order (columnwise) in the data vector corresponding to the coefficient (compatibility with BLAS). The symmetry and coercivity of the given matrix/tensor is not verified (but assumed)."

msgid "that adds an elliptic term relatively to the variable ``varname`` of the model with a constant coefficient equal to :math:`1` (a Laplacian term). This corresponds to the Laplace operator. ``mim`` is the integration method which will be used to compute the term. ``region`` is an optional region number. If it is omitted, it is assumed that the term will be computed on the whole mesh. The result of the function is the brick index in the model."
