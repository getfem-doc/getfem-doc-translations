msgid "Also different is the handling of *func* and *meth*: while previously parentheses were added to the callable name (like ``\\func{str()}``), they are now appended by the build system -- appending them in the source will result in double parentheses.  This also means that ``:func:`str(object)``` will not work as expected -- use ````str(object)```` instead!"
