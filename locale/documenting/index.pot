The markup used for the GetFEM++ documentation is `reStructuredText`_, developed by the `docutils`_ project, amended by custom directives and using a toolset named `Sphinx`_ to postprocess the HTML output."

msgid "If you're interested in contributing to GetFEM++'s documentation, there's no need to write reStructuredText if you're not so inclined; plain text contributions are more than welcome as well. The main documentations are in the directory ``doc/sphinx/source`` of the project. A part of the documentation is automatic and comes from the sources of the project. This is in particular the case for the documentations of the interface commands which are located in the ``interface/src/gf_*.cc`` files."
