msgid "The first step in filing a report is to determine whether the problem has already been reported.  The advantage in doing so, aside from saving the developers time, is that you learn what has been done to fix it; it may be that the problem has already been fixed for the next release, or additional information is needed (in which case you are welcome to provide it if you can!). To do this, search the bug database using the search box on the top of the page."
