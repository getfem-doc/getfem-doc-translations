Of course, for a real vectors this has no effect (and no cost at all). Note : ``gmm::conjugated(M)`` transposes the matrix ``M`` so that this is the hermitian conjugate of ``M``. If you need only the conjugate of each component you have to use both transposition and conjugate with ``gmm::conjugated(gmm::transposed(M))`` or equivalently  ``gmm::transposed(gmm::conjugated(M))``."
