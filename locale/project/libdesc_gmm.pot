msgid "|gmm| is a template linear algebra library which was originally designed to make an interface between the need in linear algebra procedures of |gf| and existing free linear algebra libraries (MTL, Superlu, Blas, Lapack originally). It rapidly evolves to an independent self-consistent library with its own vector and matrix types. It is now used as a base linear algebra library by several other projects."

msgid "However, it preserves the characteristic to be a potential interface for more specific packages. Any vector or matrix type having the minimum of compatibility can be used by generic algorithms of |gmm| writing a ``linalg_traits`` structure."

msgid "There is potentatialy several points to be improved in |gmm| (partial introduction of expression template for some base types of matrix and vectors, think about the way to represent in a more coherent manner sparse sub-vectors and sub-matrices, introduction of C++ concepts, etc.). However, since |gmm| globally cover the needs of |gf| and since there exists some other project like `Glas <http://glas.sourceforge.net/>`_ to build a reference C++ library for linear algebra, a global change seem to be unnecessary. This part is considered to be stabilized."

msgid "The current vocation of |gmm| is to continue to collect generic algorithms and interfaces to some other packages (DIFFPACK for instance) in order to cover new needs of the whole project. The library is now frequently used as a separate package and has also the vocation to collect the contribution of any person who propose some improvements, new algorithms or new interfaces."
