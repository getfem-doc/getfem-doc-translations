msgid "In the very begining of |gf| (the first files was written in 1995) the S.T.L. was not available and the containers defined in the ``dal`` namespace was used everywhere. Now, in |gf|, the S.T.L. containers are mainly used. The remaining uses of ``dal`` containers are eather historical or due to the specificities of these containers. It is however clear that this is not the aim of the |gf| project to develop new container concept. So, the use of the ``dal`` containers has to be as much as possible reduced."
