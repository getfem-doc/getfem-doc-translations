msgid "This release is a transitional one until next version 5.0. The new high-level generic assembly based on a weak form language is working and usable. However, the basic model bricks still use the old generic assembly and the new assembly is for the moment incompatible with a few things (Nitsche bricks and time dispatcher bricks)."
