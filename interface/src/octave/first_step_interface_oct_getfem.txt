This is a first attempt to build an interface enabling one to make Octave calls of getfem 
functions within windows 10 (64 bits). Since Octave aims to run matlab code, we followed
the installation procedure of getfem for win10. However we only installed the main 
library, superlu but not QHULL and MUMPS. 

We then moved to the directory 
msys_path\msys64\home\login\getfem-5.3\interface\src\matlab
and put the two matlab files matrix.h and tmwtypes.h

We then suppressed some class initializations in gfm_common.c (indicated in this file by
## oct-modif ##)

We then added, uncommented and modified some commands in Makefile (likewise indicated by
## oct-modif ##)

By launching a make command, we built the file gf_matlab.mex which was then copied to a 
directory related to a previous installation of getfem interface to matlab. 

Most of the basic commands of getfem then well worked. It seems that only those functions 
making use of mxArray or oop yield an error stop message. It must be noticed that 
graphical matlab commands have to be customized to octave. These either generate an error 
message or incomplete graphics or are too slow.
