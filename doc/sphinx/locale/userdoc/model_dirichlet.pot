msgid "The aim of the Dirichlet condition brick is to prescribe a Dirichlet condition on a part of the boundary of the domain for a variable of the model. This means that the value of this variable is prescribed on the boundary. There is three versions of this brick (see also the section :ref:`ud-model-Nitsche`). The first version prescribe the Dirichlet thank to a multiplier. The associated weak form of the term is the following:"

The value of the variable on that boundary is described by the data ``dataname`` which should be previously defined in the model. If the data is omitted, the Dirichlet condition is assumed to be an homogeneous one (vanishing variable on the boundary). The data can be constant or described on an FEM. It can also be scalar or vector valued, depending on the variable. The variable ``multname`` should be added to the model by the method ``add_multiplier``.

In that case, the penalization matrix is of the form :math:`B^TB` where :math:`B` is the \"mass matrix\" on the boundary between the shape functions of the variable `varname` and the shape function of the multiplier space. The penalization coefficient is added as a data of the model and can be changed thanks to the function::"

msgid "The third version of the Dirichlet condition brick use a simplification of the linear system (tangent linear system for nonlinear problems). Basically, it enforces a 1 on the diagonal components of the lines corresponding to prescribed degrees of freedom, it completes the lines with some zeros (for symmetric problems, it also complete the columns with some zeros) and it adapts the right-hand side accordingly. This is a rather simple and economic way to prescribe a Dirichlet condition. However, it can only be applied when one can identify the degrees of freedom prescribed by the the Dirichlet condition. So, it has to be use with care with reduced finite element methods, Hermite element methods and cannot be applied for a normal (or generalized) Dirichlet condition on vectorial problems. The function allowing to add this brick is::"
