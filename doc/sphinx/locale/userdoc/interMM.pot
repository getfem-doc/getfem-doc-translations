For instance if ``md`` is a valid object containing some defined variables ``u`` (vectorial) and ``p`` (scalar), one can interpolate on a Lagrange finite element method an expression such as ``p*Trace(Grad_u)``. The resulting expression can be scalar, vectorial or tensorial. The size of the resulting vector is automatically adapted."
