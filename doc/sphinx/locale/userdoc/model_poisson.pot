msgid "The following example is a part of the test program :file:`tests/laplacian_with_bricks.cc`. Construction of the mesh and finite element methods are omitted. It is assumed that a mesh is build and two finite element methods ``mf_u`` and ``mf_rhs`` are build on this mesh. Is is also assumed that ``NEUMANN_BOUNDARY_NUM`` and ``DIRICHLET_BOUNDARY_NUM`` are two valid boundary indices on that mesh. The code begins by the definition of three functions which are interpolated on ``mf_rhs`` in order to build the data for the source term, the Neumann condition and the Dirichlet condition. Follows the declaration of the model object, the addition of the bricks and the solving of the problem::"
