msgid "The object |gf_mf| defined in :file:`getfem/getfem_mesh_fem.h` is designed to describe a finite element method on a whole mesh, i.e. to describe the finite element space on which some variables will be described. This is a rather complex object which is central in |gf|. Basically, this structure describes the finite element method on each element of the mesh and some additional optional transformations. It is possible to have an arbitrary number of finite element descriptions for a single mesh. This is particularly necessary for mixed methods, but also to describe different data on the same mesh. One can instantiate a |gf_mf| object as follows::"

For usual elements, the connection between two elements is done when the two elements are compatibles (same degrees of freedom on the common face). A numeration of the degrees of freedom is automatically done with a Cuthill Mc Kee like algorithm. You have to keep in mind that there is absolutely no connection between the numeration of vertices of the mesh and the numeration of the degrees of freedom. Every |gf_mf| object has its own numeration."

The reduction matrix should transform the basic dofs into the reduced dofs (the number of reduced dofs should be less or equal than the number of basic dofs). The extension matrix should describe the inverse transformation. The product of the reduction matrix with the extension matrix should be the identity matrix (ensuring in particular that the two matrices are of maximal rank). This optional transformation can be used to reduce the finite element space to a certain region (tipically a boundary) or to prescribe some matching conditions between non naturally compatible fems (for instance fems with different degrees)."
