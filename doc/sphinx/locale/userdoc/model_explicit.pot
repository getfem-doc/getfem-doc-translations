The given matrix should have as many rows as the dimension of ``varname1`` and as many columns as the dimension of ``varname2``. If the two variables are different and if ``issymmetric`` is set to true then the transpose of the matrix is also added to the tangent system (default is false). Set ``iscoercive`` to true if the term does not affect the coercivity of the tangent system (default is false). The matrix can be changed by the command::"
