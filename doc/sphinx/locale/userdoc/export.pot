msgid "|gf| provides \"slicers\" objects which are dedicated to generating post-treatment data from meshes and solutions. These slicers, defined in the file :file:`getfem/getfem_mesh_slicers.h` take a |m| (and sometimes a |mf| with a solution field) on input, and produce a set of simplices after applying some operations such as *intersection with a plane*, *extraction of the mesh boundary*, *refinement of each convex*, *extraction of isosurfaces*, etc. The output of these slicers can be stored in a |gf_smsl| object (see the file :file:`getfem/getfem_mesh_slice.h`). A |smsl| object may be considered as a P1 discontinuous FEM on a non-conformal mesh with fast interpolation ability. Slices are made of segments, triangles and tetrahedrons, so the convexes of the original mesh are always simplexified."
