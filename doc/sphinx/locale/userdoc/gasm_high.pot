msgid "This section presents what is now the main generic assembly of |gf|. It is a high-level generic assembly in the sense that it is based on Generic Weak Form Language (GWFL, [GetFEM2020]_) to describe the weak formulation of boundary value problems of partial differential equations. A symbolic differentiation algorithm is used. It simplifies a lot the approximation of nonlinear coupled problems since only the weak form is necessary to be described, the tangent system being automatically computed. Moreover, GWFL is compiled into optimized instructions before the evaluation on each integration point in order to obtain a an optimal computational cost."

For efficiency reasons, the language manipulates tensors up to order six. The language could be easily extended to support tensors of order greater than six but it may lead to inefficient computations. When an expression contains test functions (as in ``Trace(Grad_Test_u)`` for a vector field ``u``), the computation is done for each test functions, which means that the tensor implicitly have a supplementary component.
