msgid "This section presents what is now the main generic assembly of |gf|. It is a high-level generic assembly in the sense that it is based on a weak form language to describe the weak formulation of boundary value problems of partial differential equations. It mainly has been developed to circumvent the difficulties with the previous low-level generic assembly (see  :ref:`ud-gasm-low`) for which nonlinear terms were quite difficult to describe. Conversely, a symbolic differentiation algorithm is used with this version. It simplifies a lot the approximation of nonlinear coupled problems since only the weak form is necessary to be described, the tangent system being automatically computed. Moreover, the weak form language is compiled into optimized instructions before the evaluation on each integration point in order to obtain a an optimal computational cost."

msgid "For basic linear assembly terms, the high level generic assembly is most of the time faster than the low-level one. This is due to the fact that the high-level generic assembly incorporates a compilation in basic optimized instructions and operates simplifications. On complexe terms it can be really faster due to the simplifications on repeated terms. On the other hand, the fact that the low-level generic assembly incorporates a mechanism to pre-compute on the reference element the linear term for elements with a linear transformation makes that it can be faster on a few simple linear terms. Of course, a possibility would be to incorporate the ability to pre-compute on the reference element the linear term for linear transformations in the high level generic assembly. However, it would be rather complicated due to the high genericity of the language. A consequence also is that exact integration is not allowed in the high level generic assembly."

For efficiency reasons, the language manipulates tensors up to order six. The language could be easily extended to support tensors of order greater than six but it may lead to inefficient computations. When an expression contains test functions (as in ``Trace(Grad_Test_u)`` for a vector field ``u``), the computation is done for each test functions, which means that the tensor implicitly have a supplementary component.

The components can be some numeric constants, some valid expressions and may also contain test functions. In the latter case, the vector has to be homogeneous with respect to the test functions. This means that a construction of the type ``[Test_u; Test_v]`` is not allowed. A valid example, with ``u`` as a scalar field variable is ``[5*Grad_Test_u(2), 2*Grad_Test_u(1)]``. Note also that using the quite opertor (transpose), an expression ``[a,b,c,d,e]'`` stands for 'row vector`, i.e. a 1x5 matrix."
