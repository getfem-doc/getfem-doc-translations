msgid "Although it will be more convenient to build a specific solver for some problems, a generic solver is available to test your models quickly. It can also be taken as an example to build your own solver. It is defined in :file:`src/getfem/getfem_model_solvers.h` and :file:`src/getfem_model_solvers.cc` and the call is::"
