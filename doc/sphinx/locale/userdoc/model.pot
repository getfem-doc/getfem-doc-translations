msgid "The model description of |gf| allows to quickly build some fem applications on complex linear or nonlinear PDE coupled models. The principle is to propose predefined bricks which can be assembled to describe a complex situation. A brick can describe either an equation (Poisson equation, linear elasticity ...) or a boundary condition (Dirichlet, Neumann ...) or any relation between two variables. Once a brick is written, it is possible to use it in very different situations. This allows a reusability of the produced code and the possibility of a growing library of bricks. An effort has been made in order to facilitate as much as possible the definition of a new brick. A brick is mainly defined by its contribution in the tangent linear system to be solved."

msgid "This model description is an evolution of the model bricks of previous versions of |gf|. Compared to the old system, it is more flexible, more general, allows the coupling of model (multiphysics) in a easier way and facilitates the writing of new components. It also facilitate the write of time integration schemes for evolving PDEs."
