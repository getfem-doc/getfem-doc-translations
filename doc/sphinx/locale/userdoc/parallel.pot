msgid "Of course, each different problem should require a different parallelization adapted to its specificities in order to obtain a good load balancing. You may build your own parallelization using the mesh regions to parallelize assembly procedures."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/userdoc/parallel.rst:17
msgid "Nevertheless, the brick system offers a generic parallelization based on `Open MPI <https://www.open-mpi.org>`_ (communication between processes), `METIS <http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview>`_ (partition of the mesh) and `MUMPS <http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS>`_ (parallel sparse direct solver). It is available with the compiler option ``-D GETFEM_PARA_LEVEL=2`` and the library itself has to be compiled with the option ``--enable-paralevel=2`` of the configure script. Initial MPI parallelization of |gf| has been designed with the help of Nicolas Renon from CALMIP, Toulouse."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/userdoc/parallel.rst:28
msgid "When the configure script is run with the option ``--enable-paralevel=2``, it searches for MPI, METIS and parallel MUMPS libraries. If the python interface is built, it searches also for MPI4PY library. In that case, the python interface can be used to drive the parallel version of getfem (the other interfaces has not been parallelized for the moment). See demo_parallel_laplacian.py in the interface/test/python directory."

#: ../source/userdoc/parallel.rst:36
msgid "With the option ``-D GETFEM_PARA_LEVEL=2``, each mesh used is implicitly partitionned (using METIS) into a number of regions corresponding to the number of processors and the assembly procedures are parallelized. This means that the tangent matrix and the constraint matrix assembled in the model_state variable are distributed. The choice made (for the moment) is not to distribute the vectors. So that the right hand side vectors in the model_state variable are communicated to each processor (the sum of each contribution is made at the end of the assembly and each processor has the complete vector). Note that you have to think to the fact that the matrices stored by the bricks are all distributed."

#: ../source/userdoc/parallel.rst:65
msgid "Parallelization of getfem is still considered a \"work in progress\". A certain number of procedure are still remaining sequential. Of course, a good test to see if the parallelization of your program is correct is to verify that the result of the computation is indeed independent of the number of process."

They are not parallelized themselves but aimed to be called with a different region in each process to distribute the job. Note that the file :file:`getfem/getfem_config.h` contains a procedures called MPI_SUM_SPARSE_MATRIX allowing to gather the contributions of a distributed sparse matrix."
