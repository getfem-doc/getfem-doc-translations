msgid "The original variables of the model represent the state of the system to be solved at the current time step (say step n). This is the case even for a middle point scheme, mainly because if one needs to apply different schemes to different variables of the system, all variable should describe the system at a unique time step."

msgid "Some data are added to the model to represent the state of the system at previous time steps. For classical one-step schemes (for the moment, only one-step schemes are provided), only the previous time step is stored. For instance if `u` is a variable (thus represented at step n), `Previous_u`, `Previous2_u`, `Previous3_u` will be the data representing the state of the variable at the previous time step (step n-1, n-2 and n-3)."

For instance, if `u` is a variable, `Dot_u` will represent the first order time derivative of `u` and `Dot2_u` the second order one. One can refer to these variables in the model to add a brick on it or to use it in the weak form language. However, these are not considered to be independent variables, they will be linked to their corresponding original variable (in an affine way) by the time integration scheme. Most of the schemes need also the time derivative at the previous time step and add the data `Previous_Dot_u` and possibly `Previous_Dot2_u` to the model."
