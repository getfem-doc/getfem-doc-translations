msgid "|gf| provides a generic implementation of Nitche's method which allows to account for Dirichlet type or contact with friction boundary conditions in a weak sense without the use of Lagrange multipliers. The method is very attractive because it transforms a Dirichlet boundary condition into a weak term similar to a Neumann boundary condition. However, this advantage is at the cost that the implementation of Nitche's method is model dependent, since it requires an approximation of the corresponding Neumann term. In order to add a boundary condition with Nitsche's method on a variable of a model, the corresponding brick needs to have access to an approximation of the Neumann term of all partial differential terms applied to this variable. In the following, considering a variable :math:`u`, we will denote by"

This is the case for instance for mixed formulations of incompressible elasticity.

If :math:`u` represents the displacements of a deformable body, the Neumann term will be :math:`G = \\sigma(u)n`, where :math:`\\sigma(u)` is the stress tensor depending on the constitutive law. Of course, in that case :math:`G` also depends on some material parameters. If additionally a mixed incompressibility brick is added with a variable :math:`p` denoting the pressure, the Neumann term on :math:`u` will depend on :math:`p` in the following way: :math:`G = \\sigma(u)n - pn`"

The derivation of the Neumann term works only for second order partial differential equations. A generic implementation for higher order pde would be more complicated."
