msgid "HHO method are hybrid methods in the sense that they have both degrees of freedom located on the element of a mesh and on the faces of the elements which represent separated approximations. HHO method are primal methods in the sense that both the degree of freedom in the element and on the faces represent the main unknown of the problem (no lagrange multipliers is introduced). The interest of these methods, first developped in  [Di-Er2015]_, [Di-Er2017]_ is their accuracy and their great robustness, in particular with respect to the element shapes and their locking-free properties. Moreover, they can be extended without difficulty to the approximation of nonlinear problems (see [AB-ER-PI2018]_ for hyper-elasticity, [AB-ER-PI2019]_ for plasticity and [ca-ch-er2019]_ for contact problems)."

msgid "HHO methods can be applied to arbitrary shape elements. However, the implementation in |gf| is for the moment limited to standard elements : simplices, quadrilaterals, hexahedrons, ... Moreover this implementation is still experimental and not pretending to optimality. For the moment, there is no tool to make an automatic condensation of internal dofs."

msgid "HHO elements are composite ones having a polynomial approximation space for the interior of the element and a polynomial approximation for each face of the element. Moreover, this is a discontinous approximation, in the sens that no continuity is prescribed between the approximation inside the element and the approximation on the faces, neither than between the approximations on two different faces of the element. However, when two neighbour elements share a face, the approximation on this face is shared by the two elements. |gf| provide a specific method simply called ``FEM_HHO(fem_int, fem_face1, fem_face2, ...)`` which allows to build an hybrid method from standard finite element spaces. For instance, on a triangle, a possible HHO method can be obtained with::"

msgid "The first argument to ``FEM_HHO(...)`` is the fem for the interior of the element. It has to be a discontinuous FEM. The method ``FEM_SIMPLEX_IPK(2,2)`` is a discontinous method having its degrees of freedom in the strict interior of the element, which ensure that no dof identification will be done. The second argument is the fem for the faces (if only one method is given, it will be applied to all faces, but it is also possible to give a different method for each face). Their is no verification on the fact that the given method are of discontinuous type (In fact, a method like ``FEM_HHO(FEM_PK(2,2), FEM_PK(1,2))`` will have no difference with ``FEM_PK(2,2)`` since the degree of freedom on the faces will be identified with the interior ones)."

Designed to be use on HHO element face. - ``FEM_QUAD_CIPK(k)`` : interior PK element on a quadrilateral which is additionnaly connectable. Designed to be use on HHO element face."
