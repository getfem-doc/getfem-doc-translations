msgid "For better performance on dense matrices, it is possible to interface some operations of the type ``gmm::dense_matrix<T>`` with ``LAPACK`` (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) or ``ATLAS`` (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/), for ``T = float, double, std::complex<float> or std::complex<double>``. In fact, concerning ``ATLAS`` no specific interface has been made untill now, so the fortran interface of ``ATLAS`` should be used."
