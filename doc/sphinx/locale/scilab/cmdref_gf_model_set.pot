msgid "Adds a large sliding contact with friction brick to the model based on the Nitsche's method. This brick is able to deal with self-contact, contact between several deformable bodies and contact with rigid obstacles. It uses the high-level generic assembly. It adds to the model a raytracing_interpolate_transformation object. \"unbiased_version\" refers to the version of Nische's method to be used. (unbiased or biased one). For each slave boundary a  material law should be defined as a function of the dispacement variable on this boundary. The release distance should be determined with care (generally a few times a mean element size, and less than the thickness of the body). Initially, the brick is added with no contact boundaries. The contact boundaries and rigid bodies are added with special functions. <literal>version</literal> is 0 (the default value) for the non-symmetric version and 1 for the more symmetric one (not fully symmetric even without friction)."
