msgid "Create a new sparse matrix in getfem++ format. These sparse matrix can be stored as CSC (compressed column sparse), which is the format used by Matlab, or they can be stored as WSC (internal format to getfem). The CSC matrices are not writable (it would be very inefficient), but they are optimized for multiplication with vectors, and memory usage. The WSC are writable, they are very fast with respect to random read/write operation. However their memory overhead is higher than CSC matrices, and they are a little bit slower for matrix-vector multiplications."
