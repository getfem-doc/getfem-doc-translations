For a complete reference of |gf|, please report to the `specific guides`_, but you should be able to use the |gfi|'s without any particular knowledge of the |gf| internals, although a basic knowledge about Finite Elements is required. This documentation is however not self contained. You should in particular refer to the `user documentation`_ to have a more extensive description of the structures algorithms and concepts used."
