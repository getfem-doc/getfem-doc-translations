msgid "This release is a transitional one until next version 5.0. The new high-level generic assembly based on a weak form language is working and usable. However, the basic model bricks still use the old generic assembly and the new assembly is for the moment incompatible with a few things (Nitsche bricks and time dispatcher bricks)."

#: ../source/whatsnew/4.3.rst:13
msgid "The introduction of the new high-level generic assembly, the corresponding model bricks and the associated symbolic differentiation which allows to describe non-linear coupled problems in a very easy way."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/whatsnew/4.3.rst:17
msgid "The introduction of interpolate transformations in the weak form language to deal with the assembly of terms on different meshes or part of meshes. Example of applications : mortar methods, periodic boundary conditions, large sliding contact conditions"
