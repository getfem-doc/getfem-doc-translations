msgid "The mesh_fem object has undergone significant changes. Now it is possible to perform linear combination of degrees of freedom in order to describe some special finite element spaces. The main application is to obtain a finite element space reduced on a boundary or a curve. But it can be used also to prescribe directly some matching condition. The main change in the use of the mesh_fem object is the introduction of \"basic\" and \"reduced\" dofs. See the documentation."

msgid "The partial_mesh_fem object has been completely changed. It is now a lighter object which is intensively used in the new model bricks to obtain finite element spaces on a boundary."

msgid "Introduction of the new model brick system. The bricks are more simple to build and it is now really designed to the representation of coupled/multiphysics models. A generic manner to deals with time dependent models from static models is also introduced."
