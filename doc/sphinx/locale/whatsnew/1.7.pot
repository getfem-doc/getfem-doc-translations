msgid "Introduction of the `model brick` system, which provides a general framework for the solution of common PDEs. Each brick is dedicated to a specific task (i.e. \"handle Dirichlet conditions\", \"assembly of the Stokes Problem\", \"solve a linear system\", etc.). These bricks are then connected to each other. Examples of use can be found in the \"tests/\" directory of getfem++."

Note that, while it is `documented <http://getfem.org/python/index.html>`_ and working, the python interface is still considered a *work in progress*. You have to enable it explicitly with ``./configure --enable-python``. An interface to the Gmm++ sparse matrices and solvers is also provided."
