msgid "The Fem module is the part of |gf| which describes the finite elements at the element level and the degrees of freedom. Finite element methods can be of different types. They could be scalar or vectorial, polynomial, piecewise polynomial or non-polynomial, equivalent via the geometric transformation or not. Moreover, the description of the degrees of freedom have to be such that it is possible to gather the compatible degrees of freedom between two neighbour elements in a generic way (for instance connecting a Lagrange 2D element to another Lagrange 1D element)."

msgid "The principal dissatisfaction of this module is that description of the degrees of freedom is not completely satisfactory. It is the principal reason why one documentation on how to build an element from A to Z was not made for the moment because description of the degrees of freedom was conceived to be temporary. An effort of design is thus to be provided to completely stabilize this module mainly thus with regard to the description of degrees of freedom but also perhaps the description of finite elements which could be partially externalized in a similar way to the cubature methods , at least for the simplest finite elements (equivalent and polynomial finite elements)."
