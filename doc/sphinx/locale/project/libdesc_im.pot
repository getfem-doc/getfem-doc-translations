msgid "The CUBATURE module gives access to the numerical integration methods on reference elements. In fact it does not only contain some cubature formulas because it also give access to some exact integration methods. However, the exact integration methods are only usable for polynomial element and affine geometric transformations. This explain why exact integration methods are not widely used. The description of cubature formulas is done either directly in the file :file:`getfem_integration.h` or via a description file in the directory ``cubature`` of |gf|. The addition of new cubature formulas is then very simple, it suffices to reference the element on which it is defined and the list of Gauss points in a file and add it to this directory. Additionally, In order to integrate terms defined on a boundary of a domain, the description should also contains the reference to a method of same order on each face of the element."
