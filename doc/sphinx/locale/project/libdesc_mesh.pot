msgid "This part of the library has the role to store and manage the meshes, i.e. a collection of elements (real elements) connected to each other by some of their faces. For that, it develops concepts of elements, elements of reference, structure of meshes, collection of nodes, geometric transformations, subpart of the boundary or subzone of the mesh."

#: ../source/project/libdesc_mesh.rst:24
msgid "There is no really effective meshing capabilities available for the moment in |gf|. The meshes of complex objects must be imported from existing meshers such as `Gmsh`_ or `GiD`_. Some importing functions of meshes have been written and can be easily extended for other formats."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/project/libdesc_mesh.rst:29
msgid "The object which represents a mesh declared in the file :file:`getfem_mesh.h` and which is used as a basis for handling of the meshes in |gf| manages also the possibility for the structures depending on a mesh (see MESHFEM and MESHIM modules) to react to the evolution of the mesh (addition or removal of elements, etc.)."
