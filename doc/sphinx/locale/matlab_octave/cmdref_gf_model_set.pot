msgid "Add a generic elliptic term to the model relatively to the variable `varname`. The shape of the elliptic term depends both on the variable and the data. This corresponds to a term :math:`-\\text{div}(a\\nabla u)` where :math:`a` is the data and :math:`u` the variable. The data can be a scalar, a matrix or an order four tensor. The variable can be vector valued or not. If the data is a scalar or a matrix and the variable is vector valued then the term is added componentwise. An order four tensor data is allowed for vector valued variable only. The data can be constant or describbed on a fem. Of course, when the data is a tensor describe on a finite element method (a tensor field) the data can be a huge vector. The components of the matrix/tensor have to be stored with the fortran order (columnwise) in the data vector (compatibility with blas). The symmetry of the given matrix/tensor is not verified (but assumed). If this is a vector valued variable, the elliptic term is added componentwise. `region` is an optional mesh region on which the term is added. If it is not specified, it is added on the whole mesh. Note that for the real version which uses the high-level generic assembly language, `dataname` can be any regular expression of the high-level generic assembly language (like \"1\", \"sin(X(1))\" or \"Norm(u)\" for instance) even depending on model variables.

Remember that in both cases, a multiplier is stored anyway. `varnames` is a set of variable and data names with length which may depend on the plastic law (at least the displacement, the plastic multiplier and the plastic strain). `params` is a list of expressions for the parameters (at least elastic coefficients and the yield stress). These expressions can be some data names (or even variable names) of the model but can also be any scalar valid expression of the high level assembly language (such as '1/2', '2+sin(X[0])', '1+Norm(v)' ...). The last two parameters optionally provided in `params` are the `theta` parameter of the `theta`-scheme (generalized trapezoidal rule) used for the plastic strain integration and the time-step`dt`. The default value for `theta` if omitted is 1, which corresponds to the classical Backward Euler scheme which is first order consistent. `theta=1/2` corresponds to the Crank-Nicolson scheme (trapezoidal rule) which is second order consistent. Any value between 1/2 and 1 should be a valid value. The default value of `dt` is 'timestep' which simply indicates the time step defined in the model (by md.set_time_step(dt)). Alternatively it can be any expression (data name, constant value ...). The time step can be altered from one iteration to the next one. `region` is a mesh region."
