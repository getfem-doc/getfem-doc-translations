  What's New in |gf| 4.3
****************************

This release is a transitional one until next version 5.0. The new high-level generic assembly based on a weak form language is working and usable. However, the basic model bricks still use the old generic assembly and the new assembly is for the moment incompatible with a few things (Nitsche bricks and time dispatcher bricks).

Released version, 2014/07/14.

The main changes are:

   * The introduction of the new high-level generic assembly, the
     corresponding model bricks and the associated symbolic differentiation
     which allows to describe non-linear coupled problems in a very easy way.

   * The introduction of interpolate transformations in the weak form language
     to deal with the assembly of terms on different meshes or part of meshes.
     Example of applications : mortar methods, periodic boundary conditions,
     large sliding contact conditions

   * A large sliding contact with friction brick is now working
     (work of Konstantinos Poulios and Yves Renard) and will be extended soon.

   * A support for Nitsche type method for Dirichlet and contact conditions.        the corresponding model bricks will certainly evolve to incorporate the
     use of the high-level generic assembly.

   * A torus_mesh_fem object allowing to easily transform 3D problems into
     axi-symmetric ones (work of Lim Liang Jin).

   * New im_data objects to store and interpolate data on Gauss points
     of an integration method (work of Lim Liang Jin).

   * Multithreaded assembly (Work of Andriy Andreykiv)

   * New hyperelastic laws implemented and necessary tools in the high-level
     generic assembly to describe new potentials  (matrix invariants ...)

   * Allowing tensor field for mesh_fem objects

   * Many bug fixes.
