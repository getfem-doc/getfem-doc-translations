  What's New in |gf| 5.3
************************

The main contribution of this version is the extension of the language allowing macro definition and explicit differentiation.

Released version, 2018/06/22.

The main changes are:

   * The weak form language now supports macro with parameters

   * The weak form language has been extended with Grad(expression),
     the spatial gradient and Diff(expression, variable, direction)
     which performs a directional derivative. A few more tensor contraction
     operations has been added on this occasion.

   * The support for pyramidal has been extended and stabilized.

   * Incomplete pyramidal (13-node) and incomplete prism (15-node)
     elements have been added.

   * Importing meshes from ANSYS has been improved/extended.
