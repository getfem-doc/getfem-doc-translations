************************
  What's New in |gf| 5.2
************************

The main contribution of this release is the sharp optimization of the high level generic assembly. Speed up in assembly time can be very important. The first pyramidal elements were also designed.

Released version, 2017/06/30.

The main changes are:

   * |gf| project is now hosted by `Savannah <https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/getfem>`_.

   * Sharp optimization of the high level generic assembly: optimization of
     the most used instructions and most used elements, optimization of the
     storage into sparse matrix optimization, factorization of some elementary
     operations, etc.

   * Isoparametric Lagrange pyramidal elements of degree 1 and 2 have been
     added together with corresponding quadrature methods.

   * Python interface is now compatible with Python 3.x versions.

   * Import of Ansys meshes.

   * A new transformation has been added to the weak form
     language for the extrapolation on a neighbour element.

   * Compatibility for Windows and Mac installation has been checked.

   * For std::vector<T> the overload of std::cout << V << endl; added to gmm
     induces some conflicts. Is has been suppressed. Please use instead
     std::cout << gmm::vref(V) << endl;
