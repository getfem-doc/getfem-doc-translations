  What's New in |gf| 2.0
************************

   Released, 2006/03/20:

   * This is a major update to |gf|, which make some
     backward-incompatible changes:

     * The old mesh_fem has been split into two disjoint classes:
       ``mesh_fem`` which handles all that is related to FEM, and
       ``mesh_im`` which handles the integration methods on a mesh.

     * The old ``getfem::getfem_mesh`` class has been renamed to
       ``getfem::mesh``.

     * The "boundaries" which were attached to a ``mesh_fem`` in
       previous versions, are now attached to a ``mesh``, and they
       are now called "regions" (because they can stored boundaries,
       and also sets of convexes).

     * The model bricks have been reworked -- especially the
       Dirichlet conditions.

   * Some news features have been introduced in this release:

     * Introduction of level-set objects. Integration methods can be
       cut with respect to these level-set and discontinuous
       elements across the level-set are provided.

     * Parallelization of the assembly.

     * Interface to `MUMPS`.

     * Many news elements, Hermite and vectorial elements are now
       fully supported: 1D, 2D and 3D hermite, Argyris triangle, HCT
       triangle, RT0 and Nedelec elements are now available.

     * Automatic mesh refinement.

Major changes for the matlab and python interface: they follow the
changes that occured in |gf|. An interface to the |gf| model
bricks has been added.
