  What's New in |gf| 4.2
************************

The New brick system is now mature and several coupling bricks has been developed.

Released version, 2012/08/02.

The main changes are:

   * The license of |gf| has moved to LGPL 3 with GCC Runtime Exception
     allowing commercial codes to use Getfem.

   * Contact/friction bricks has been extended to non-matching meshes and
     to integral contact condition with different augmentations (Alart Curnier,
     De Saxce projection, augmented multipliers) (work of Konstantinos Poulios
     and Yves Renard). A large sliding contact brick is in progress.

   * A complete tool to perform continuation of the solution to a model with
     respect to one of its parameter and to detect bifurcation has been
     developed by Tomas Ligursky.

   * Some additional model bricks : pointwise constraint brick (to prescribe
     a constraint on a point eventually inside an element), basic nonlinear
     brick (for instance, for semi-linear equations).

   * It is now possible to solve a model with respect to a subset of variables.

   * The experimental mesher of Getfem is now (partially) interfaced with
     python/scilab/matlab.

   * Some tools to verify the consistency (tangent term) of a brick or
     the whole model has been added.

   * Many bug fixes.
