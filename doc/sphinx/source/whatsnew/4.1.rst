  What's New in |gf| 4.1
****************************

After |gf| 4.0, which introduced the new brick system and a significant
change of the mesh_fem object, the 4.1 release consists mainly in the
stabilization and the completion of the new brick system.
The main changes are:

   Released version, 2010/07/18:


   * The following bricks have been rewritten in the new format:
	 nonlinear elasticity,
         bilaplacian,
         unilateral contact and Coulomb friction (still in progress with the help of Konstantinos  Poulios),
         elastoplasticity.

   * A fully working and documented Scilab interface with the same graphical
     post-treatment utilities than the Matlab one has been built by
     Yann Collette. Very important contribution.

   * An important internal modification of the Python/Scilab/Matlab interface
     has been performed mainly in order to simplify the add of new methods
     or commands. There is now a unique source which are the gf_*.cc
     files. All the documentations and command files (mfiles and python file)
     are produced automatically.

   * The official documentation is now the one in doc/sphinx. Thank you
     to Luis Saavedra for is important work to re-write the main part of the
     documentations into the sphinx/rst format.
     Documentation for the interfaces are now fully automatic.

   * A convection scheme based on Characteristic Galerkin method has been
     added. Useful to update the level-sets.

   * Muparser can now be used to specify some parametrable enrichments in Xfem.
