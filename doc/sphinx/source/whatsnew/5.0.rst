  What's New in |gf| 5.0
************************

This is a major release of |gf|. The main evolution is the generalization of the use of the high-level generic assembly for a more easy writting of nonlinear coupled problems. The few incompatibilities come from the fact that a certain number of tools have been re-designed (mainly Nitsche's bricks and time integration schemes) and the old brick system (from 1.7 release) have been definitevely unplugged.

Released version, 2015/07/29.

The main changes are:

   * Standard bricks (generic elliptic, elasticity ...) are now based on the
     high-level generic assembly.

   * Nitsche's bricks have been re-designed.

   * The support for time integration schemes has been re-designed.

   * The support for large sliding contact has been improved (still a work in
     progress).

   * Import of GMSH meshes has been improved.

   * New tutorial and new Python/Scilab/Matlab demos.

   * Allowing tensor field for model data.

   * Cleaning/deletion of some obsolete files, including the old brick system.

   * MPI and OpenMP parallelization of the high-level generic assembly.

   * The use of mu_parser have been replaced by the use of the weak
     form language. mu_parser in no longer a dependence of |gf|.

   * Add of "elementary transformations" in the weak form language
     to allow for instance a local projection of a finite element on a lower
     level element to perform a reduction such as the one used in MITC element.

   * Macro definition in the weak form language.

   * Numerical continuation/bifurcation detection/branching improved.

   * Matrix exponential and logarithm operators added to the weak form language.

   * Allowing the use of C++11 feature.

   * New im_data object version to store and interpolate data on the
     gauss points of a boundary.
