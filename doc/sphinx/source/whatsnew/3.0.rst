  What's New in |gf| 3.0
************************

Not so many changes, but some of them are incompatible with |gf| 2.0:

   Released, 2007/06/27:

   * The |gf| and Gmm++ header files have been moved into their
     respective subdirectories. So, as a consequence, the include
     directives have to be updated:

     * ``#include "gmm_xxx.h"`` should be replaced with
       ``#include "gmm/gmm_xxx.h"``

     * ``#include "getfem_xxx.h"`` should be replaced with
       ``#include "getfem/getfem_xxx.h"``

   * The |gf| interface (Python and Matlab) is now included in the
     |gf| tar.gz file, in the `interface` subdirectory. They can
     be enabled with the ``--enable-python`` or ``--enable-matlab``
     switch of the configure script.

   * Some `C1` composite elements have been added (triangles and
     quadrilaterals).

   * Levelset support has been improved.

The full list of changes is available in the `ChangeLog`.
