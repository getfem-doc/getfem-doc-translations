  What's New in |gf| 1.6
************************

   Released, 2004/01/23:

   * |gf| 1.6 is mostly a bugfix and performance improvements release:

     * Some new integration methods were added (high order methods for
       triangles such as ``IM_TRIANGLE(19)`` from P. Solin, K. Segeth
       and I. Dolezel: *Higher-Order & Finite Element Methods*,
       Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, 2003).

     * Performance of interpolation and geometric transformation inversion
       was much improved.

     * Support for emc2 meshes.

   * The Gmm++ library has been much improved version 1.6 and version 1.5.
     We have especially focused on its robustness:

     * Many bugs were fixed, especially for complex matrices.

     * QR algorithms were introduced for dense matrices.

     * A `LAPACK/ATLAS` interface is available.

     * `SuperLU 2.0` interface.

     * Small simplification in ``linalg_traits`` structure.

     * Generic resize procedures for vector and matrices were introduced.

     * It is possible to use a column or row matrix view of a vector with
       ``gmm::row_vector`` and ``gmm::col_vector``.

     * Generic ``gmm::reshape`` and ``gmm::conjugated`` functions.

     * Intensive tests with random type of matrices and vectors.
