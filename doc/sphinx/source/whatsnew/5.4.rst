  What's New in |gf| 5.4
************************

The main contribution of this version is a fully functional scripting language interface to Octave and support for definition and condensation of internal variables.

Released version, 2020/04/22.

The main changes are:

   * A fully working Octave interface. Many thanks to Abderrahmane Bendali
     for the initial adaptation of this interface from Matlab's one.

   * Support for (internal) variables defined at integration points

   * Full support for the automatic condensation of internal variables by
     local equations expressed in the generic weak form language. Useful
     for instance in the implementation of plasticity models.

   * The use of Python 3 instead of Python 2.7 by default

   * Support for Hybrid High-Order methods
   
   * Support for the the assembly of product of terms defined on two
     different domains (integration on the product of two domains with a
     kernel, for instance).

   * Support for Lumped Mass Matrix
  
   * Support for Houbolt method
