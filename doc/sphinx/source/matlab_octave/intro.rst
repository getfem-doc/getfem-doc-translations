Introduction
============

This guide provides a reference about the |octv|/|Mlab| interface of |gf|.
For a complete  reference of |gf|, please report to the `specific guides`_,
but you should be able to use the |gfi|'s without any particular knowledge
of the |gf| internals, although a basic knowledge about Finite Elements
is required. This documentation is however not self contained. You should in
particular refer to the `user documentation`_ to have a more extensive
description of the structures algorithms and concepts used.
