**Description :**


  General function for modification of a mesh object.


**Command list :**



  ``PIDs = gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'pts', mat PTS)``

    Replace the coordinates of the mesh points with those given in `PTS`.


  ``PIDs = gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'add point', mat PTS)``

    Insert new points in the mesh and return their #ids.
    
    `PTS` should be an ``nxm`` matrix , where ``n`` is the mesh
    dimension, and ``m`` is the number of points that will be
    added to the mesh. On output, `PIDs` contains the point #ids
    of these new points.
    
    Remark: if some points are already part of the mesh (with a small
    tolerance of approximately ``1e-8``), they won't be inserted again,
    and `PIDs` will contain the previously assigned #ids of these
    points.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'del point', ivec PIDs)``

    Removes one or more points from the mesh.
    
    `PIDs` should contain the point #ids, such as the one returned by
    the 'add point' command.


  ``CVIDs = gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'add convex', geotrans GT, mat PTS)``

    Add a new convex into the mesh.
    
    The convex structure (triangle, prism,...) is given by `GT`
    (obtained with gf_geotrans('...')), and its points are given by
    the columns of `PTS`. On return, `CVIDs` contains the convex #ids.
    `PTS` might be a 3-dimensional array in order to insert more than
    one convex (or a two dimensional array correctly shaped according
    to Fortran ordering).


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'del convex', mat CVIDs)``

    Remove one or more convexes from the mesh.
    
    `CVIDs` should contain the convexes #ids, such as the ones
    returned by the 'add convex' command.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'del convex of dim', ivec DIMs)``

    Remove all convexes of dimension listed in `DIMs`.
    
    For example; ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'del convex of dim', [1,2])`` remove
    all line segments, triangles and quadrangles.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'translate', vec V)``

    Translates each point of the mesh from `V`.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'transform', mat T)``

    Applies the matrix `T` to each point of the mesh.
    
    Note that `T` is not required to be a ``NxN`` matrix (with
    ``N = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'dim')``). Hence it is possible to transform
    a 2D mesh into a 3D one (and reciprocally).


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'boundary', int rnum, mat CVFIDs)``

    DEPRECATED FUNCTION. Use 'region' instead.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'region', int rnum, mat CVFIDs)``

    Assigns the region number `rnum` to the set of convexes or/and convex
    faces provided in the matrix `CVFIDs`.
    
    The first row of `CVFIDs` contains convex #ids, and the second row
    contains a face number in the convex (or 0
    for the whole convex (regions are usually used to store a list of
    convex faces, but you may also use them to store a list of convexes).
    
    If a vector is provided (or a one row matrix) the region will represent
    the corresponding set of convex.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'extend region', int rnum, mat CVFIDs)``

    Extends the region identified by the region number `rnum` to include
    the set of convexes or/and convex faces provided in the matrix
    `CVFIDs`, see also ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'set region)``.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'region intersect', int r1, int r2)``

    Replace the region number `r1` with its intersection with region number `r2`.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'region merge', int r1, int r2)``

    Merge region number `r2` into region number `r1`.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'region subtract', int r1, int r2)``

    Replace the region number `r1` with its difference with region
    number `r2`.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'delete boundary', int rnum, mat CVFIDs)``

    DEPRECATED FUNCTION. Use 'delete region' instead.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'delete region', ivec RIDs)``

    Remove the regions whose #ids are listed in `RIDs`


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'merge', mesh m2[, scalar  tol])``

    Merge with the mesh `m2`.
    
    Overlapping points, within a tolerance radius `tol`, will not be
    duplicated. If `m2` is a mesh_fem object, its linked mesh will be used.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'optimize structure'[, int with_renumbering])``

    Reset point and convex numbering.
    
    After optimisation, the points (resp. convexes) will
    be consecutively numbered from 1 to gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max pid')
    (resp. gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max cvid')).


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'refine'[, ivec CVIDs])``

    Use a Bank strategy for mesh refinement.
    
    If `CVIDs` is not given, the whole mesh is refined. Note
    that the regions, and the finite element methods and
    integration methods of the mesh_fem and mesh_im objects linked
    to this mesh will be automagically refined.
