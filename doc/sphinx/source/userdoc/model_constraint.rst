Constraint brick
----------------

The constraint brick allows to add an explicit constraint on a variable. Explicit
means that no integration is done. if :math:`U` is a variable then a constraint of
the type

.. math::

   BU = L,

can be added with the two following functions::

  indbrick = getfem::add_constraint_with_penalization(md, varname,
                                                      penalisation_coeff, B, L);
  indbrick = getfem::add_constraint_with_multipliers(md, varname,
                                                     multname, B, L);

In the second case, a (fixed size) variable which will serve as a multiplier
should be first added to the model.

For the penalized version ``B`` should not contain a plain row, otherwise the
whole tangent matrix will be plain. The penalization parameter can be changed
thanks to the function::

  change_penalization_coeff(md, ind_brick, penalisation_coeff);

It is possible to change the constraints at any time thanks to the two following
functions::

  getfem::set_private_data_matrix(md, indbrick, B)
  getfem::set_private_data_rhs(md, indbrick, L)

where ``indbrick`` is the index of the brick in the model.
