Build a mesh
============

As a preliminary, you may want to read this short introduction to the |gf|
`vocabulary`_.

|gf| has its own structure to store meshes defined in the files
:file:`getfem/bgeot_mesh_structure.h` and :file:`getfem/getfem_mesh.h`. The main
structure is defined in :file:`getfem/getfem_mesh.h` by the object |gf_m|.

This object is able to store any element in any dimension even if you mix
elements with different dimensions.

There is only a (very) experimental meshing procedure in |gf| to mesh complex geometries. But you can easily load a mesh from any format (some
procedures are in :file:`getfem/getfem_import.h` to load meshes from some public
domain mesh generators).

The structure |gf_m| may also contain a description about a region of the mesh,
such as a boundary or a set of elements. This is handled via a container of
convexes and convex faces, |gf_mr|. We refer to [remacle2002]_ for a discussion on mesh representation.


Add an element to a mesh
------------------------

Suppose the variable ``mymesh`` has been declared by::

  getfem::mesh mymesh;

then you have two ways to insert a new element to this mesh: from a list of
points or from a list of indexes of already existing points.

To enter a new point on a mesh use the method::

  i = mymesh.add_point(pt);

where ``pt`` is of type |bg_bn|. The index ``i`` is the index of this point on
the mesh. If the point already exists in the mesh, a new point is not inserted
and the index of the already existing point is returned. A mesh has a principal
dimension, which is the dimension of its points. It is not possible to have
points of different dimensions in a same mesh.

The most basic function to add a new element to a mesh is::

  j = mymesh.add_convex(pgt, it);

This is a template function, with ``pgt`` of type |bg_pgt| (basically a pointer
to an instance of type |bg_gt|) and ``it`` is an iterator on a list of indexes of
already existing points. For instance, if one needs to add a new triangle in a 3D
mesh, one needs to define first an array with the indexes of the three points::

  std::vector<bgeot::size_type> ind(3);
  ind[0] = mymesh.add_point(bgeot::base_node(0.0, 0.0, 0.0));
  ind[1] = mymesh.add_point(bgeot::base_node(0.0, 1.0, 0.0));
  ind[2] = mymesh.add_point(bgeot::base_node(0.0, 0.0, 1.0));

then adding the element is done by::

  mymesh.add_convex(bgeot::simplex_geotrans(2,1), ind.begin());

where ``bgeot::simplex_geotrans(N,1);`` denotes the usual linear geometric
transformation for simplices of dimension N.

For simplices, a more specialized function exists, which is::

  mymesh.add_simplex(2, ind.begin());

It is also possible to give directly the list of points with the function::

  mymesh.add_convex_by_points(pgt, itp);

where now ``itp`` is an iterator on an array of points. For example::

  std::vector<bgeot::base_node> pts(3);
  pts[0] = bgeot::base_node(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  pts[1] = bgeot::base_node(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  pts[2] = bgeot::base_node(0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
  mymesh.add_convex_by_points(bgeot::simplex_geotrans(2,1), pts.begin());

It is possible to use also::

  mymesh.add_simplex_by_points(2, pts.begin());

For other elements than simplices, it is still possible to use
``mymesh.add_convex_by_points`` or ``mymesh.add_convex`` with the appropriate
geometric transformation.

* ``bgeot::parallelepiped_geotrans(N, 1)`` describes the usual transformation for
  parallelepipeds of dimension ``N`` (quadrilateron for ``N=2``, hexahedron for
  ``N=3``, ...)

* ``bgeot::prism_geotrans(N, 1)`` describes the usual transformation for prisms of
  dimension ``N`` (usual prism is for ``N=3``. A generalized prism is the product
  of a simplex of dimension ``N-1`` with a segment)

Specialized functions exist also::

  mymesh.add_parallelepiped(N, it);
  mymesh.add_parallelepiped_by_points(N, itp);
  mymesh.add_prism(N, it);
  mymesh.add_prism_by_points(N, itp);

The order of the points in the array of points is not important for simplices
(except if you care about the orientation of your simplices). For other elements, it is important to respect the vertex order shown in :ref:`ud-fig-elem` (first order elements).

.. _ud-fig-elem:
.. figure:: images/getfemuserelem.png
   :align: center
   :width: 15cm

   Vertex numeration for usual first order elements

Note that a general rule, including for higher order transformations, is that the vertex numeration follows the one of the corresponding Lagrange finite element method (see  :ref:`ud-appendixa`).


Remove an element from a mesh
-----------------------------

To remove an element from a mesh, simply use::

  mymesh.sup_convex(i);

where ``i`` is the index of the element.


Simple structured meshes
------------------------

For parallelepiped domains, it is possible to obtain structured meshes with
simplices, parallelepipeds or prisms elements from three functions defined in
:file:`getfem/getfem_regular_meshes.h`.

The simplest function to use is::

  void regular_unit_mesh(mesh& m, std::vector<size_type> nsubdiv,
                         bgeot::pgeometric_trans pgt, bool noised = false);

which fills the mesh ``m`` with a regular mesh of simplices/parallelepipeds/prisms
(depending on the value of ``pgt``). The number of cells in each direction is given
by ``nsubdiv``. The following example builds a mesh of quadratic triangles on the
unit square (the mesh can be scaled and translated afterwards)::

  std::vector<getfem::size_type> nsubdiv(2);
  nsubdiv[0] = 10; nsubdiv[1] = 20;
  regular_unit_mesh(m, nsubdiv, bgeot::simplex_geotrans(2,2));

More specialized regular mesh functions are also available::

  getfem::parallelepiped_regular_simplex_mesh(mymesh, N, org, ivect, iref);
  getfem::parallelepiped_regular_prism_mesh(mymesh, N, org, ivect, iref);
  getfem::parallelepiped_regular_pyramid_mesh(mymesh, N, org, ivect, iref);
  getfem::parallelepiped_regular_mesh(mymesh, N, org, ivect, iref);

where ``mymesh`` is a mesh variable in which the structured mesh will be built,
``N`` is the dimension (limited to 4 for simplices, 5 for prisms, unlimited for
parallelepipeds), ``org`` is of type ``bgeot::base_node`` and represents the
origin of the mesh, ``ivect`` is an iterator on an array of ``N`` vectors to
build the parallelepiped domain, ``iref`` is an iterator on an array of ``N``
integers representing the number of division on each direction.

For instance, to build a mesh with tetrahedrons for a unit cube with
:math:`10\times~10\times~10` cells one can write::

  getfem::mesh mymesh;
  bgeot::base_node org(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  std::vector<bgeot::base_small_vector> vect(3);
  vect[0] = bgeot::base_small_vector(0.1, 0.0, 0.0);
  vect[1] = bgeot::base_small_vector(0.0, 0.1, 0.0);
  vect[2] = bgeot::base_small_vector(0.0, 0.0, 0.1);
  std::vector<int> ref(3);
  ref[0] = ref[1] = ref[2] = 10;
  getfem::parallelepiped_regular_simplex_mesh(mymesh, 3, org, vect.begin(), ref.begin());

.. note::

   ``base_node`` and ``base_small_vector`` are almost identical, they are both
   ''small'' vector classes (they cannot store more than 16 elements), used to
   describe geometrical points, and geometrical vectors. Their memory footprint
   is lower than a ``std::vector``.

..  _ud-mesh_regions:

Mesh regions
------------

A mesh object can contain many |gf_mr| objects (declaration in
:file:`getfem/getfem_mesh_region.h`). These objects are containers for a set of
convexes and convex faces. They are used to define boundaries, or a partition of
the mesh for parallel solvers, etc.::

  mymesh.region(30).add(2);   // adds convex 2 into region 30
  mymesh.region(30).add(3);   // adds convex 3 into region 30
  mymesh.region(30).add(4,3); // adds face 3 of convex 4 into region 30
  mymesh.region(30).sup(3);   // Removes convex 3 from region 30
  mymesh.sup_convex(4);       // Removes convex 4 from both the mesh and all the regions
  for (getfem::mr_visitor i(mymesh.region(30)); !i.finished(); ++i) {
    cout << "convex: " << i.cv() << " face:" << i.f() << endl;
  }

Methods of the |gf_m| object
----------------------------

The list is not exhaustive.

.. function:: mymesh.dim()

   main dimension of the mesh.

.. function:: mymesh.points_index()

   gives a ``dal::bit_vector`` object which represents all the indexes
   of valid points of a mesh (see below).

.. function:: mymesh.points()[i]

   gives the point of index ``i`` (a ``bgeot::base_node``).

.. function:: mymesh.convex_index()

   gives a ``dal::bit_vector`` object which represents all the indexes
   of valid elements of a mesh (see below).

.. function:: mymesh.structure_of_convex(i)

   gives the description of the structure of element of index ``i``. The function
   return a |bg_pcs|.

.. function:: mymesh.structure_of_convex(i)->nb_faces()

   number of faces of element of index ``i``.

.. function:: mymesh.structure_of_convex(i)->nb_points()

   number of vertices of element of index ``i``.

.. function:: mymesh.structure_of_convex(i)->dim()

   intrinsic dimension of element of index ``i``.


.. function:: mymesh.structure_of_convex(i)->nb_points_of_face(f)

   number of vertices of the face of local index ``f`` of element
   of index ``i``.

.. function:: mymesh.structure_of_convex(i)->ind_points_of_face(f)

   return a container with the local indexes of all vertices of the
   face of local index ``f`` of element of index ``i``. For instance
   ``mesh.structure_of_convex(i)->ind_points_of_face(f)[0]`` is the
   local index of the first vertex.

.. function:: mymesh.structure_of_convex(i)->face_structure(f)

   gives the structure (a |bg_pcs|) of local index ``f``
   of element of index ``i``.

.. function:: mymesh.ind_points_of_convex(i)

   gives a container with the global indexes of vertices of element of
   index ``i``.

.. function:: mymesh.points_of_convex(i)

   gives a container with the vertices of element of index ``i``. This
   is an array of ``bgeot::base_node``.

.. function:: mymesh.convex_to_point(ipt)

   gives a container with the indexes of all elements attached to the
   point of global index ``ipt``.

.. function:: mymesh.neighbours_of_convex(ic, f)

   gives a container with the indexes of all elements in ``mesh`` having
   the common face of local index ``f`` of element ``ic`` except element
   ``ic``.

.. function:: mymesh.neighbour_of_convex(ic, f)

   gives the index of the first elements in ``mesh`` having the common
   face of local index ``f`` of element ``ic`` except element ``ic``.
   return size_type(-1) if none is found.

.. function:: mymesh.is_convex_having_neighbour(ic, f)

   return whether or not the element ``ic`` has a neighbour with respect
   to its face of local index ``f``.

.. function:: mymesh.clear()

   delete all elements and points from the mesh.


.. function:: mymesh.optimize_structure()

   compact the structure (renumbers points and convexes such that there
   is no hole in their numbering).

.. function:: mymesh.trans_of_convex(i)

   return the geometric transformation of the element of index ``i`` (in
   a |bg_pgt|). See :ref:`dp` for more details about geometric transformations.

.. function:: mymesh.normal_of_face_of_convex(ic, f, pt)

   gives a ``bgeot::base_small_vector`` representing an outward normal
   to the element at the face of local index ``f`` at the point of local
   coordinates (coordinates in the element of reference) ``pt``. The
   point ``pt`` has no influence if the geometric transformation is
   linear. This is not a unit normal, the norm of the resulting vector
   is the ratio between the surface of the face of the reference
   element and the surface of the face of the real element.

.. function:: mymesh.convex_area_estimate(ic)

   gives an estimate of the area of convex ``ic``.

.. function:: mymesh.convex_quality_estimate(ic)

   gives a rough estimate of the quality of element ``ic``.

.. function:: mymesh.convex_radius_estimate(ic)

   gives an estimate of the radius of element ``ic``.

.. function:: mymesh.region(irg)

   return a |gf_mr|. The region is stored in the mesh, and can
   contain a set of convex numbers and or convex faces.

.. function:: mymesh.has_region(irg)

   returns true if the region of index ``irg`` has been created.

The methods of the convexes/convex faces container ``getfem::mesh_region`` are:

.. function:: add(ic)

   add the convex of index ``ic`` to the region.

.. function:: add(ic,f)

   add the face number ``f`` of the convex ``ic``.

.. function:: sup(ic)
              sup(ic,f)

   remove the convex or the convex face from the region.

.. function:: is_in(ic)
              is_in(ic,f)

   return true if the convex (or convex face) is in the region.

.. function:: is_only_faces()

   return true if the region does not contain any convex.

.. function:: is_only_convexes()

   return true if the region does not contain any convex face.

.. function:: index()

   return a ``dal::bit_vector`` containing the list of convexes
   which are stored (or whose faces are stored) in the region.

Iteration over a |gf_mr| should be done with |gf_mrv|::

  getfem::mesh_region &rg = mymesh.region(2);
  for (getfem::mr_visitor i(rg); !i.finished(); ++i) {
    cout << "contains convex " < < i.cv();
    if (i.is_face()) cout  << "face " << i.f() << endl;
  }

Using |dal_bv|
--------------

The object |dal_bv| (declared in :file:`getfem/dal_bit_vector.h`) is a structure
heavily used in |gf|. It is very close to ``std::bitset`` and
``std::vector<bool>`` but with additional functionalities to represent a set of
non negative integers and iterate over them.

If ``nn`` is declared to be a |dal_bv|, the two
instructions ``nn.add(6)`` or ``nn[6] = true`` are equivalent and
means that integer 6 is added to the set.

In a same way ``nn.sup(6)`` or ``nn[6] = false`` remove the integer 6
from the set. The instruction ``nn.add(6, 4)`` adds 6,7,8,9 to the
set.

To iterate on a |dal_bv|, it is possible to use iterators
as usual, but, most of the time, as this object represents a set of
integers, one just wants to iterate on the integers included into the
set. The simplest way to do that is to use the pseudo-iterator
|dal_bv_v|.

For instance, here is the code to iterate on the points of a mesh and
print it to the standard output::

  for (dal::bv_visitor i(mymesh.points_index()); !i.finished(); ++i)
    cout << "Point of index " << i << " of the mesh: " << mymesh.points()[i] << endl;

Face numbering
--------------

The numeration of faces on usual elements is given in figure :ref:`ud-fig-elemf`.

.. _ud-fig-elemf:
.. figure:: images/getfemuserelemf.png
   :align: center
   :width: 12cm

   faces numeration for usual elements

Note that, while the convexes and the points are globally numbered in a |gf_m|
object, there is no global numbering of the faces, so the only way to refer to
a given face, is to give the convex number, and the local face number in the
convex.

..  _ud-load_save_mesh:

Save and load meshes
--------------------

From |gf| file format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In :file:`getfem/getfem_mesh.h`, two methods are defined to load meshes from file
and write meshes to a file.

.. function:: mymesh.write_to_file(const std::string &name)

   save the mesh into a file.

.. function:: mymesh.read_from_file(const std::string &name)

   load the mesh from a file.

The following is an example of how to load a mesh and extract information on it::

  #include <getfem/getfem_mesh.h>

  getfem::mesh mymesh;

  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    try {
      // read the mesh from the file name given by the first argument
      mymesh.read_from_file(std::string(argv[1]));

      // List all the convexes
      dal::bit_vector nn = mymesh.convex_index();
      bgeot::size_type i;
      for (i << nn; i != bgeot::size_type(-1); i << nn) {
        cout << "Convex of index " << i << endl;
        bgeot::pconvex_structure cvs = mymesh.structure_of_convex(i);
        cout << "Number of vertices: " << cvs->nb_points() << endl;
        cout << "Number of faces: " << cvs->nb_faces() << endl;
        for (bgeot::short_type f = 0; f < cvs->nb_faces(); ++f) {
          cout << "face " << f << " has " << cvs->nb_points_of_face(f);
          cout << " vertices with local indexes: ";
          for (bgeot::size_type k = 0; k < cvs->nb_points_of_face(f); ++k)
            cout << cvs->ind_points_of_face(f)[k] << " ";
          cout << " and global indexes: ";
          for (bgeot::size_type k = 0; k < cvs->nb_points_of_face(f); ++k)
            cout << mymesh.ind_points_of_convex(i)[cvs->ind_points_of_face(f)[k]] << " ";
        }
      }
    } GMM_STANDARD_CATCH_ERROR; // catches standard errors
  }

Import a mesh
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The file :file:`getfem/getfem_import.h` provides the function::

  void import_mesh(const std::string& fmtfilename, mesh& m);

Here the string ``fmtfilename`` must contain a descriptor of the
file format ("gid", "gmsh", "cdb", "noboite", "am_fmt", "emc2_mesh",
or "structured"), followed by a colon and the file name (if there is
not format descriptor, it is assumed that the file is a native getfem
mesh and the ``mesh::read_from_file()`` method is used). Example::

   getfem::mesh m;
   getfem::import_mesh("gid:../tests/meshes/tripod.GiD.msh",m);

Alternatively the function::

  void import_mesh(const std::string& filename, const std::string& fmt,
                   mesh& m);

can be used in an equivalent manner with the string ``fmt`` being one of
the aforementioned format specifiers.

The "gid" format specifier is for meshes generated by `GiD`_ and "gmsh"
is for meshes generated by the open-source mesh generator `Gmsh`_.
The "cdb" format specifier is for reading meshes from `ANSYS <http://www.ansys.com>`_ models
exported in blocked format with the CDWRITE command. Currently the
`ANSYS`_ element types 42,45,73,82,87,89,90,92,95,162,182,183,185,186,187
and 191 can be imported, this however does not include any finite element
techology linked to these elements but only their geometry.
The "noboite" format is for TetMesh-GHS3D, and the
"am_fmt" and "emc2_mesh" are for files built with `EMC2`_ (but 2D only).

The "structured" format is just a short specification for regular meshes:
the rest of ``fmtfilename`` in that case is not a filename, but a string
whose format is following::

  getfem::import_mesh("structured:GT='GT_PK(2,1)';"
                      "NSUBDIV=[5,5];"
                      "ORG=[0,0];"
                      "SIZES=[1,1];"
                      "NOISED=0", m);

where ``GT`` is the name of the geometric transformation, ``NSUBDIV`` a
vector of the number of subdivisions in each coordinate (default value 2),
``ORG`` is the origin of the mesh (default value ``[0,0,...]``), ``SIZES``
is a vector of the sizes in each direction (default value ``[1, 1, ...]``
and if ``NOISED=1`` the nodes of the interior of the mesh are randomly
"shaken" (default value ``NOISED=0``). In that string, all the parameters
are optional except ``GT``.
