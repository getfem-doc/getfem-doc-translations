Source term bricks (and Neumann condition)
------------------------------------------

This brick adds a source term, i.e. a term which occurs only in the right hand side
of the linear (tangent) system build by the model. If :math:`f` denotes the value
of the source term, the weak form of such a term is

.. math::

   \int_{\Omega} f v\ dx

where :math:`v` is the test function. The value :math:`f` can be constant or
described on a finite element method.

It can also represent a Neumann condition if it is applied on a boundary of the
domain.

The function to add a source term to a model is::

  add_source_term_brick(md, mim,
                        varname, dataexpr, region = -1,
                        directdataname = std::string());

where ``md``is the model object, ``mim`` is the integration method, ``varname`` is
the variable of the model for which the source term is added, ``dataexpr`` has to be  a regular expression of GWFL, the generic weak form language (except for the complex version where it has to be a declared data of the model). It has to be
scalar or vector valued depending on the fact that the variable is scalar or
vector valued itself. ``region`` is a mesh region on which the term is added. If
the region corresponds to a boundary, the source term will represent a Neumann
condition. ``directdataname`` is an optional additional data which will directly
be added to the right hand side without assembly.

The brick has a working complex version.

A slightly different brick, especially dedicated to deal with a Neumann condition,
is added by the following function::

  add_normal_source_term_brick(md, mim,
                               varname, dataexpr, region);

The difference compared to the basic source term brick is that the data should be
a vector field (a matrix field if the variable ``varname`` is itself vector
valued) and a scalar product with the outward unit normal is performed on it.
