Arguments listed between square brackets are optional. Lists between braces indicate that the argument must match one of the elements of the list. For example::

  >> [X,Y]=dummy(int i, 'foo' | 'bar' [,vec v])

means that the dummy function takes two or three arguments, its first being an integer value, the second a string which is either 'foo' or 'bar', and a third optional argument. It returns two values (with the usual matlab meaning, i.e. the caller can always choose to ignore them).

**Description :**



  General assembly function.

  Many of the functions below use more than one mesh_fem: the main
  mesh_fem (mf_u) used for the main unknown, and data mesh_fem (mf_d)
  used for the data. It is always assumed that the Qdim of mf_d is
  equal to 1: if mf_d is used to describe vector or tensor data, you
  just have to "stack" (in fortran ordering) as many scalar fields as
  necessary.


**Command list :**



  ``{...} = gf_asm('generic', mesh_im mim, int order, string expression, int region, [model model, ['Secondary_domain', 'name',]] [string varname, int is_variable[, {mesh_fem mf, mesh_imd mimd}], value], ['select_output', 'varname1'[, 'varname2]], ...)``

    High-level generic assembly procedure for volumic or boundary assembly.
    
    Performs the generic assembly of <literal>expression</literal> with the integration
    method <literal>mim</literal> on the mesh region of index <literal>region</literal> (-1 means all
    elements of the mesh). The same mesh should be shared by
    the integration method and all the finite element methods or
    mesh_im_data corresponding to the variables.
    
    <literal>order</literal> indicates either that the (scalar) potential
    (order = 0) or the (vector) residual (order = 1) or the
    tangent (matrix) (order = 2) is to be computed.
    
    <literal>model</literal> is an optional parameter allowing to take into account
    all variables and data of a model. Note that all enabled variables
    of the model will occupy space in the returned vector/matrix
    corresponding to their degrees of freedom in the global system, even
    if they are not present in <literal>expression</literal>.
    
    The variables and constants (data) are listed after the region number
    (or optionally the model).
    For each variable/constant, a name must be given first (as it is
    referred in the assembly string), then an integer equal to 1 or 0
    is expected respectively for declaring a variable or a constant,
    then the finite element method if it is a fem variable/constant or
    the mesh_im_data if it is data defined on integration points, and
    the vector representing the value of the variable/constant.
    It is possible to give an arbitrary number of variable/constant.
    The difference between a variable and a constant is that test
    functions are only available for variables, not for constants.
    
    <literal>select_output</literal> is an optional parameter which allows to reduce the
    output vector (for <literal>order</literal> equal to 1) or the matrix (for <literal>order</literal>
    equal to 2) to the degrees of freedom of the specified variables.
    One variable has to be specified for a vector output and two for a
    matrix output.
    
    Note that if several variables are given, the assembly of the
    tangent matrix/residual vector will be done considering the order
    in the call of the function (the degrees of freedom of the first
    variable, then of the second one, and so on). If a model is provided,
    all degrees of freedom of the model will be counted first, even if
    some of the model variables do not appear in <literal>expression</literal>.
    
    For example, the L2 norm of a vector field "u" can be computed with::
    
      gf_compute('L2 norm') or with the square root of:
    
      gf_asm('generic', mim, 0, 'u.u', -1, 'u', 1, mf, U);
    
    The nonhomogeneous Laplacian stiffness matrix of a scalar field can be evaluated with::
    
      gf_asm('laplacian', mim, mf, mf_data, A) or equivalently with:
    
      gf_asm('generic', mim, 2, 'A*Grad_Test2_u.Grad_Test_u', -1, 'u', 1, mf, U, 'A', 0, mf_data, A);
      


  ``M = gf_asm('mass matrix', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf1[, mesh_fem mf2[, int region]])``

    Assembly of a mass matrix.
    
    Return a spmat object.


  ``L = gf_asm('laplacian', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, mesh_fem mf_d, vec a[, int region])``

    Assembly of the matrix for the Laplacian problem.
    
    <latex style="text"><![CDATA[\nabla\cdot(a(x)\nabla u)]]></latex>  with <literal>a</literal> a scalar.
    
    Return a spmat object.


  ``Le = gf_asm('linear elasticity', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, mesh_fem mf_d, vec lambda_d, vec mu_d[, int region])``

    Assembles of the matrix for the linear (isotropic) elasticity problem.
    
    <latex style="text"><![CDATA[\nabla\cdot(C(x):\nabla u)]]></latex>
    with <latex style="text"><![CDATA[C]]></latex> defined via <literal>lambda_d</literal> and <literal>mu_d</literal>.
    
    Return a spmat object.


  ``TRHS = gf_asm('nonlinear elasticity', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, vec U, string law, mesh_fem mf_d, mat params, {'tangent matrix'|'rhs'|'incompressible tangent matrix', mesh_fem mf_p, vec P|'incompressible rhs', mesh_fem mf_p, vec P})``

    Assembles terms (tangent matrix and right hand side) for nonlinear elasticity.
    
    The solution <literal>U</literal> is required at the current time-step. The <literal>law</literal>
    may be choosen among:
    
    - 'SaintVenant Kirchhoff':
      Linearized law, should be avoided. This law has the two usual
      Lame coefficients as parameters, called lambda and mu.
    - 'Mooney Rivlin':
      This law has three parameters, called C1, C2 and D1.
      Can be preceded with the words 'compressible' or 'incompressible' to force
      a specific version. By default, the incompressible version is considered
      which requires only the first two material coefficients.
    - 'neo Hookean':
      A special case of the 'Mooney Rivlin' law that requires one material
      coefficient less (C2 = 0). By default, its compressible version is used.
    - 'Ciarlet Geymonat':
      This law has 3 parameters, called lambda, mu and gamma, with
      gamma chosen such that gamma is in ]-lambda/2-mu, -mu[.
    
    The parameters of the material law are described on the mesh_fem <literal>mf_d</literal>.
    The matrix <literal>params</literal> should have <literal>nbdof(mf_d)</literal> columns, each row
    correspounds to a parameter.
    
    The last argument selects what is to be built: either the tangent
    matrix, or the right hand side. If the incompressibility is
    considered, it should be followed by a mesh_fem <literal>mf_p</literal>, for the
    pression.
    
    Return a spmat object (tangent matrix), vec object (right hand
    side), tuple of spmat objects (incompressible tangent matrix), or
    tuple of vec objects (incompressible right hand side).


  ``A = gf_asm('helmholtz', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, mesh_fem mf_d, vec k[, int region])``

    Assembly of the matrix for the Helmholtz problem.
    
    <latex style="text"><![CDATA[\Delta u + k^2 u]]></latex> = 0,  with <literal>k</literal> complex scalar.
    
    Return a spmat object.


  ``A = gf_asm('bilaplacian', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, mesh_fem mf_d, vec a[, int region])``

    Assembly of the matrix for the Bilaplacian problem.
    
    <latex style="text"><![CDATA[\Delta(a(x)\Delta u) = 0]]></latex>   with <literal>a</literal> scalar.
    
    Return a spmat object.


  ``A = gf_asm('bilaplacian KL', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, mesh_fem mf_d, vec a, vec nu[, int region])``

    Assembly of the matrix for the Bilaplacian problem with Kirchhoff-Love formulation.
    
    <latex style="text"><![CDATA[\Delta(a(x)\Delta u) = 0]]></latex>   with <literal>a</literal> scalar.
    
    Return a spmat object.


  ``V = gf_asm('volumic source', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, mesh_fem mf_d, vec fd[, int region])``

    Assembly of a volumic source term.
    
    Output a vector <literal>V</literal>, assembled on the mesh_fem <literal>mf_u</literal>, using the data
    vector <literal>fd</literal> defined on the data mesh_fem <literal>mf_d</literal>. <literal>fd</literal> may be real or
    complex-valued.
    
    Return a vec object.


  ``B = gf_asm('boundary source', int bnum, mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, mesh_fem mf_d, vec G)``

    Assembly of a boundary source term.
    
    <literal>G</literal> should be a [Qdim x N] matrix, where N is the number of dof
    of <literal>mf_d</literal>, and Qdim is the dimension of the unkown u (that is set
    when creating the mesh_fem).
    
    Return a vec object.


  ``{HH, RR} = gf_asm('dirichlet', int bnum, mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, mesh_fem mf_d, mat H, vec R [, scalar threshold])``

    Assembly of Dirichlet conditions of type <literal>h.u = r</literal>.
    
    Handle <literal>h.u = r</literal> where h is a square matrix (of any rank) whose
    size is equal to the dimension of the unkown u. This matrix is
    stored in <literal>H</literal>, one column per dof in <literal>mf_d</literal>, each column containing
    the values of the matrix h stored in fortran order:
    
    .. math::
    
      <literal>H(:,j) = [h11(x_j) h21(x_j) h12(x_j) h22(x_j)]</literal>
    
    if u is a 2D vector field.
    
    Of course, if the unknown is a scalar field, you just have to set
    <literal>H = ones(1, N)</literal>, where N is the number of dof of <literal>mf_d</literal>.
    
    This is basically the same than calling gf_asm('boundary qu term')
    for <literal>H</literal> and calling gf_asm('neumann') for <literal>R</literal>, except that this
    function tries to produce a 'better' (more diagonal) constraints
    matrix (when possible).
    
    See also gf_spmat_get(spmat S, 'Dirichlet_nullspace').


  ``Q = gf_asm('boundary qu term',int boundary_num, mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_u, mesh_fem mf_d, mat q)``

    Assembly of a boundary qu term.
    
    <literal>q</literal> should be be a [Qdim x Qdim x N] array, where N is the number
    of dof of <literal>mf_d</literal>, and Qdim is the dimension of the unkown u (that
    is set when creating the mesh_fem).
    
    Return a spmat object.

    Define a new function <literal>name</literal> which can be used in high level
    generic assembly. The function can have one or two parameters.
    In <literal>expression</literal> all available predefined function or operation
    of the generic assembly can be used. However, no reference to
    some variables or data can be specified. The argument of the
    function is <literal>t</literal> for a one parameter function and <literal>t</literal> and <literal>u</literal>
    for a two parameter function. For instance 'sin(pi*t)+2*t*t'
    is a valid expression for a one parameter function and
    'sin(max(t,u)*pi)' is a valid expression for a two parameters
    function. <literal>expression_derivative_t</literal> and <literal>expression_derivative_u</literal>
    are optional expressions for the derivatives with respect
    to <literal>t</literal> and <literal>u</literal>. If they are not furnished, a symbolic derivation
    is used.


  ``gf_asm('undefine function', string name)``

    Cancel the definition of a previously defined function <literal>name</literal>
    for the high level generic assembly.


  ``gf_asm('define linear hardening function', string name, scalar sigma_y0, scalar H, ... [string 'Frobenius'])``

    Define a new linear hardening function under the name <literal>name</literal>, with
    initial yield stress <literal>sigma_y0</literal> and hardening modulus H.
    If an extra string argument with the value 'Frobenius' is provided,
    the hardening function is expressed in terms of Frobenius norms of its
    input strain and output stress, instead of their Von-Mises equivalents.


  ``gf_asm('define Ramberg Osgood hardening function', string name, scalar sigma_ref, {scalar eps_ref | scalar E, scalar alpha}, scalar n[, string 'Frobenius'])``

    Define a new Ramberg Osgood hardening function under the name <literal>name</literal>,

    If an extra string argument with the value 'Frobenius' is provided,
    the hardening function is expressed in terms of Frobenius norms of its
    input strain and output stress, instead of their Von-Mises equivalents.

    Analyse a high-level generic assembly expression and print
    information about the provided expression.


  ``{...} = gf_asm('volumic' [,CVLST], expr [, mesh_ims, mesh_fems, data...])``

    Low-level generic assembly procedure for volumic assembly.
    
    The expression <literal>expr</literal> is evaluated over the mesh_fem's listed in the
    arguments (with optional data) and assigned to the output arguments.
    For details about the syntax of assembly expressions, please refer
    to the getfem user manual (or look at the file getfem_assembling.h
    in the GetFEM sources).
    
    For example, the L2 norm of a field can be computed with::
    
      gf_compute('L2 norm') or with the square root of:
    
      gf_asm('volumic','u=data(#1); V()+=u(i).u(j).comp(Base(#1).Base(#1))(i,j)',mim,mf,U)
    
    The Laplacian stiffness matrix can be evaluated with::
    
      gf_asm('laplacian',mim, mf, mf_data, A) or equivalently with:
    
      gf_asm('volumic','a=data(#2);M(#1,#1)+=sym(comp(Grad(#1).Grad(#1).Base(#2))(:,i,:,i,j).a(j))', mim,mf,mf_data,A);

    involved here, and <literal>mfi</literal> has to be lagrangian. In the more general
    case, you would have to do a L2 projection via the mass matrix.

  ``n = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'L2 dist', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf2, vec U2[, mat CVids])``

    Compute the L2 distance between <literal>U</literal> and <literal>U2</literal>.
    
    If <literal>CVids</literal> is given, the norm will be computed only on the listed
    elements.


  ``n = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'H1 semi norm', mesh_im mim[, mat CVids])``

    Compute the L2 norm of grad(<literal>U</literal>).
    
    If <literal>CVids</literal> is given, the norm will be computed only on the listed
    elements.


  ``n = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'H1 semi dist', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf2, vec U2[, mat CVids])``

    Compute the semi H1 distance between <literal>U</literal> and <literal>U2</literal>.
    
    If <literal>CVids</literal> is given, the norm will be computed only on the listed
    elements.


  ``n = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'H1 norm', mesh_im mim[, mat CVids])``

    Compute the H1 norm of <literal>U</literal>.
    
    If <literal>CVids</literal> is given, the norm will be computed only on the listed
    elements.


  ``n = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'H2 semi norm', mesh_im mim[, mat CVids])``

    Compute the L2 norm of D^2(<literal>U</literal>).
    
    If <literal>CVids</literal> is given, the norm will be computed only on the listed
    elements.


  ``n = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'H2 norm', mesh_im mim[, mat CVids])``

    Compute the H2 norm of <literal>U</literal>.
    
    If <literal>CVids</literal> is given, the norm will be computed only on the listed

  ``DU = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'gradient', mesh_fem mf_du)``

    Compute the gradient of the field <literal>U</literal> defined on mesh_fem <literal>mf_du</literal>.
    
    The gradient is interpolated on the mesh_fem <literal>mf_du</literal>, and returned in
    <literal>DU</literal>. For example, if <literal>U</literal> is defined on a P2 mesh_fem, <literal>DU</literal> should be
    evaluated on a P1-discontinuous mesh_fem. <literal>mf</literal> and <literal>mf_du</literal> should
    share the same mesh.
    
    <literal>U</literal> may have any number of dimensions (i.e. this function is not
    restricted to the gradient of scalar fields, but may also be used
    for tensor fields). However the last dimension of <literal>U</literal> has to be
    equal to the number of dof of <literal>mf</literal>. For example, if <literal>U</literal> is a
    [3x3xNmf] array (where Nmf is the number of dof of <literal>mf</literal>), <literal>DU</literal> will
    be a [Nx3x3[xQ]xNmf_du] array, where N is the dimension of the mesh,
    Nmf_du is the number of dof of <literal>mf_du</literal>, and the optional Q dimension
    is inserted if <literal>Qdim_mf != Qdim_mf_du</literal>, where Qdim_mf is the Qdim of
    <literal>mf</literal> and Qdim_mf_du is the Qdim of <literal>mf_du</literal>.


  ``HU = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'hessian', mesh_fem mf_h)``

    Compute the hessian of the field <literal>U</literal> defined on mesh_fem <literal>mf_h</literal>.
    
    See also gf_compute('gradient', mesh_fem mf_du).


  ``UP = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'eval on triangulated surface', int Nrefine, [vec CVLIST])``

    [OBSOLETE FUNCTION! will be removed in a future release]
    Utility function designed for 2D triangular meshes : returns a list
    of triangles coordinates with interpolated U values. This can be
    used for the accurate visualization of data defined on a
    discontinous high order element. On output, the six first rows of UP
    contains the triangle coordinates, and the others rows contain the
    interpolated values of U (one for each triangle vertex) CVLIST may
    indicate the list of convex number that should be consider, if not
    used then all the mesh convexes will be used. U should be a row
    vector.


  ``Ui = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'interpolate on', {mesh_fem mfi | slice sli | vec pts})``

    Interpolate a field on another mesh_fem or a slice or a list of points.
    
    - Interpolation on another mesh_fem <literal>mfi</literal>:
       <literal>mfi</literal> has to be Lagrangian. If <literal>mf</literal> and <literal>mfi</literal> share the same
       mesh object, the interpolation will be much faster.
    - Interpolation on a slice <literal>sli</literal>:
       this is similar to interpolation on a refined P1-discontinuous
       mesh, but it is much faster. This can also be used with
       gf_slice('points') to obtain field values at a given set of
       points.
    - Interpolation on a set of points <literal>pts</literal>
    
    See also gf_asm('interpolation matrix')


  ``Ue = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'extrapolate on', mesh_fem mfe)``

    Extrapolate a field on another mesh_fem.
    
    If the mesh of <literal>mfe</literal> is stricly included in the mesh of <literal>mf</literal>, this
    function does stricly the same job as gf_compute('interpolate_on').
    However, if the mesh of <literal>mfe</literal> is not exactly included in <literal>mf</literal>
    (imagine interpolation between a curved refined mesh and a coarse
    mesh), then values which are outside <literal>mf</literal> will be
    extrapolated.
    
    See also gf_asm('extrapolation matrix')


  ``E = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'error estimate', mesh_im mim)``

    Compute an a posteriori error estimate.
    
    Currently there is only one which is available: for each convex,
    the jump of the normal derivative is integrated on its faces.


  ``E = gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'error estimate nitsche', mesh_im mim, int GAMMAC, int GAMMAN, scalar lambda_, scalar mu_, scalar gamma0, scalar f_coeff, scalar vertical_force)``

    Compute an a posteriori error estimate in the case of Nitsche method.
    
    Currently there is only one which is available: for each convex,
    the jump of the normal derivative is integrated on its faces.


  ``gf_compute(mesh_fem MF, vec U, 'convect', mesh_fem mf_v, vec V, scalar dt, int nt[, string option[, vec per_min, vec per_max]])``

    Compute a convection of <literal>U</literal> with regards to a steady state velocity
    field <literal>V</literal> with a Characteristic-Galerkin method. The result is returned
    in-place in <literal>U</literal>.
    This method is restricted to pure Lagrange fems for U. <literal>mf_v</literal> should
    represent a continuous finite element method. <literal>dt</literal> is the integration time
    and <literal>nt</literal> is the number of integration step on the caracteristics. <literal>option</literal>
    is an option for the part of the boundary where there is a re-entrant
    convection.
    <literal>option = 'extrapolation'</literal> for an extrapolation on the nearest element,
    <literal>option = 'unchanged'</literal> for a constant value on that boundary or
    <literal>option = 'periodicity'</literal> for a peridiodic boundary. For this latter option
    the two vectors per_min, per_max has to be given and represent the limits
    of the periodic domain (on components where per_max[k] < per_min[k]
    no operation is done).
    This method is rather dissipative, but stable.

    Initialise the Moore-Penrose continuation: Return a unit tangent to
    the solution curve at the point given by <literal>solution</literal> and <literal>parameter</literal>,

**Command list :**



  ``I = gf_integ(string method)``

    Here is a list of some integration methods defined in GetFEM (see the
    description of finite element and integration methods for a complete
    reference):
    
     - IM_EXACT_SIMPLEX(n) :
       Exact integration on simplices (works only with linear geometric
       transformations and PK fem's).
     - IM_PRODUCT(A,B) :
       Product of two integration methods.
     - IM_EXACT_PARALLELEPIPED(n) :
       Exact integration on parallelepipeds.
     - IM_EXACT_PRISM(n) :
       Exact integration on prisms.
     - IM_GAUSS1D(k) :
       Gauss method on the segment, order <literal>k=1,3,...,99</literal>.
     - IM_NC(n,k) :
       Newton-Cotes approximative integration on simplexes, order <literal>k</literal>.
     - IM_NC_PARALLELEPIPED(n,k) :
       Product of Newton-Cotes integration on parallelepipeds.
     - IM_NC_PRISM(n,k) :
       Product of Newton-Cotes integration on prisms.
     - IM_GAUSS_PARALLELEPIPED(n,k) :
       Product of Gauss1D integration on parallelepipeds.
     - IM_TRIANGLE(k) :
       Gauss methods on triangles <literal>k=1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,13,17,19</literal>.
     - IM_QUAD(k) :
       Gauss methods on quadrilaterons <literal>k=2,3,5, ...,17</literal>. Note that
       IM_GAUSS_PARALLELEPIPED should be prefered for QK fem's.
     - IM_TETRAHEDRON(k) :
       Gauss methods on tetrahedrons <literal>k=1,2,3,5,6 or 8</literal>.
     - IM_SIMPLEX4D(3) :
       Gauss method on a 4-dimensional simplex.

    Example:
    
     - I = gf_integ('IM_PRODUCT(IM_GAUSS1D(5),IM_GAUSS1D(5))')
    
    is the same as:
    
     - I = gf_integ('IM_GAUSS_PARALLELEPIPED(2,5)')
    
    Note that 'exact integration' should be avoided in general, since they
    only apply to linear geometric transformations, are quite slow, and
    subject to numerical stability problems for high degree fem's.

  This object is able to store any element in any dimension even if you mix
  elements with different dimensions.

  


**Command list :**



  ``M = gf_mesh('empty', int dim)``

    Create a new empty mesh.


  ``M = gf_mesh('cartesian', vec X[, vec Y[, vec Z,..]])``

    Build quickly a regular mesh of quadrangles, cubes, etc.


  ``M = gf_mesh('pyramidal', vec X[, vec Y[, vec Z,..]])``

    Build quickly a regular mesh of pyramids, etc.


  ``M = gf_mesh('cartesian Q1', vec X, vec Y[, vec Z,..])``

    Build quickly a regular mesh of quadrangles, cubes, etc. with
    Q1 elements.


  ``M = gf_mesh('triangles grid', vec X, vec Y)``

    Build quickly a regular mesh of triangles.
    
    This is a very limited and somehow deprecated function (See also
    <literal></literal>gf_mesh('ptND')<literal></literal>, <literal></literal>gf_mesh('regular simplices')<literal></literal> and
    <literal></literal>gf_mesh('cartesian')<literal></literal>).


  ``M = gf_mesh('regular simplices', vec X[, vec Y[, vec Z,...]]['degree', int k]['noised'])``

    Mesh a n-dimensional parallelepiped with simplices (triangles,
    tetrahedrons etc) .
    
    The optional degree may be used to build meshes with non linear
    geometric transformations.


  ``M = gf_mesh('curved', mesh m, vec F)``

    Build a curved (n+1)-dimensions mesh from a n-dimensions mesh <literal>m</literal>.
    
    The points of the new mesh have one additional coordinate, given by
    the vector <literal>F</literal>. This can be used to obtain meshes for shells. <literal>m</literal> may
    be a mesh_fem object, in that case its linked mesh will be used.


  ``M = gf_mesh('prismatic', mesh m, int nl[, int degree])``

    Extrude a prismatic mesh <literal>M</literal> from a mesh <literal>m</literal>.
    
    In the additional dimension there are <literal>nl</literal> layers of elements
    distributed from <literal></literal>0<literal></literal> to <literal></literal>1<literal></literal>.
    If the optional parameter <literal>degree</literal> is provided with a value greater
    than the default value of <literal></literal>1<literal></literal>, a non-linear transformation of
    corresponding degree is considered in the extrusion direction.


  ``M = gf_mesh('pt2D', mat P, imat T[, int n])``

    Build a mesh from a 2D triangulation.
    
    Each column of <literal>P</literal> contains a point coordinate, and each column of <literal>T</literal>
    contains the point indices of a triangle. <literal>n</literal> is optional and is a
    zone number. If <literal>n</literal> is specified then only the zone number <literal>n</literal> is
    converted (in that case, <literal>T</literal> is expected to have 4 rows, the fourth
    containing these zone numbers).
    
    


  ``M = gf_mesh('ptND', mat P, imat T)``

    Build a mesh from a n-dimensional "triangulation".
    
    Similar function to 'pt2D', for building simplexes meshes from a
    triangulation given in <literal>T</literal>, and a list of points given in <literal>P</literal>. The
    dimension of the mesh will be the number of rows of <literal>P</literal>, and the
    dimension of the simplexes will be the number of rows of <literal>T</literal>.


  ``M = gf_mesh('load', string filename)``

    Load a mesh from a GetFEM ascii mesh file.
    
    See also <literal></literal>gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'save', string filename)<literal></literal>.


  ``M = gf_mesh('from string', string s)``

    Load a mesh from a string description.
    
    For example, a string returned by <literal></literal>gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'char')<literal></literal>.


  ``M = gf_mesh('import', string format, string filename)``

    Import a mesh from the file <literal>filename</literal>.
    
    <literal>format</literal> may be:
    
    - 'gmsh' for a mesh created with <literal>Gmsh</literal>
    - 'gmsh_with_lower_dim_elt' for a mesh created with <literal>Gmsh</literal> and including elements of lower dimension than the mesh
    - 'gid' for a mesh created with <literal>GiD</literal>
    - 'cdb' for a mesh created with <literal>ANSYS</literal>
    - 'am_fmt' for a mesh created with <literal>EMC2</literal>
    - 'structured' for a structured cartesian mesh.
      In this case <literal>filename</literal> is a string describing the mesh
      e.g. "GT='GT_QK(2,2)';ORG=[0,0];SIZES=[1,1];NSUBDIV=[5,10]"
    - 'structured_ball' for a structured mesh of a circular disc or a sphere.
      In this case <literal>filename</literal> is a string describing the mesh
      "GT='GT_QK(2,2)';ORG=[0,0];SIZES=[4];NSUBDIV=[3,4];SYMMETRIES=1"
      The number of symmetries divides a circle into a half (1) or quarter
      of circle (2). Similarly a sphere can be divided with up to 3 symmetry
      planes.


  ``M = gf_mesh('clone', mesh m2)``

    Create a copy of a mesh.


  ``M = gf_mesh('generate', mesher_object mo, scalar h[, int K = 1[, mat vertices]])``

    Call the experimental mesher of GetFEM on the geometry represented
    by <literal>mo</literal>. Please control the conformity of the produced mesh. You can
    help the mesher by adding a priori vertices in the array <literal>vertices</literal>
    which should be of size <literal></literal>n x m<literal></literal> where <literal></literal>n<literal></literal> n is the dimension of
    the mesh and <literal></literal>m<literal></literal> the number of points. <literal>h</literal> is approximate diameter
    of the elements. <literal>K</literal> is the degree of the mesh (>1 for curved boundaries).
    The mesher will try to optimize the quality of the elements. This
    operation may be time consuming. Note that if the mesh generation fails,
    because of some random procedure used, it can be run again since it will
    not give necessarily the same result due to random procedures used.
    The messages send to the console by the mesh generation can be
    deactivated using <literal>gf_util('trace level', 2)</literal>. More information
    can be obtained by <literal>gf_util('trace level', 4)</literal>. See <literal></literal>gf_mesher_object<literal></literal>
    to manipulate geometric primitives in order to describe the geometry.

**Description :**


  General mesh inquiry function. All these functions accept also a
  mesh_fem argument instead of a mesh M (in that case, the mesh_fem
  linked mesh will be used). 


**Command list :**



  ``d = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'dim')``

    Get the dimension of the mesh (2 for a 2D mesh, etc).


  ``np = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'nbpts')``

    Get the number of points of the mesh.


  ``nc = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'nbcvs')``

    Get the number of convexes of the mesh.


  ``P = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'pts'[, ivec PIDs])``

    Return the list of point coordinates of the mesh.
    
    Each column of the returned matrix contains the coordinates of one
    point. If the optional argument <literal>PIDs</literal> was given, only the points
    whose #id is listed in this vector are returned. Otherwise, the
    returned matrix will have gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max_pid') columns, which might
    be greater than gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'nbpts') (if some points of the mesh have
    been destroyed and no call to gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'optimize structure') have
    been issued). The columns corresponding to deleted points will be
    filled with NaN. You can use gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'pid') to filter such invalid
    points.


  ``Pid = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'pid')``

    Return the list of points #id of the mesh.
    
    Note that their numbering is not supposed to be contiguous from
    1 to gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'nbpts'),
    especially if some points have been removed from the mesh. You
    can use gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'optimize_structure') to enforce a contiguous
    numbering. 


  ``PIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'pid in faces', imat CVFIDs)``

    Return point #id listed in <literal>CVFIDs</literal>.
    
    <literal>CVFIDs</literal> is a two-rows matrix, the first row lists convex #ids,
    and the second lists face numbers. On return, <literal>PIDs</literal> is a
    vector containing points #id.


  ``PIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'pid in cvids', imat CVIDs)``

    Return point #id listed in <literal>CVIDs</literal>.
    
    <literal>PIDs</literal> is a vector containing points #id.


  ``PIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'pid in regions', imat RIDs)``

    Return point #id listed in <literal>RIDs</literal>.
    
    <literal>PIDs</literal> is a vector containing points #id.


  ``PIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'pid from coords', mat PTS[, scalar radius=0])``

    Return point #id whose coordinates are listed in <literal>PTS</literal>.
    
    <literal>PTS</literal> is an array containing a list of point coordinates. On
    return, <literal>PIDs</literal> is a vector containing points
    #id for each point found in <literal>eps</literal> range, and -1 for those
    which where not found in the mesh.


  ``{Pid, IDx} = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'pid from cvid'[, imat CVIDs])``

    Return the points attached to each convex of the mesh.
    
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> is omitted, all the convexes will be considered
    (equivalent to <literal>CVIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max cvid')</literal>). <literal>IDx</literal> is a
    vector, length(IDx) = length(CVIDs)+1. <literal>Pid</literal> is a
    vector containing the concatenated list of #id of
    points of each convex in <literal>CVIDs</literal>. Each entry of <literal>IDx</literal> is the
    position of the corresponding convex point list in <literal>Pid</literal>. Hence,
    for example, the list of #id of points of the second convex is
    Pid(IDx(2):IDx(3)-1).
    
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> contains convex #id which do not exist in the mesh,
    their point list will be empty.


  ``{Pts, IDx} = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'pts from cvid'[, imat CVIDs])``

    Search point listed in <literal>CVID</literal>.
    
    Return <literal>Pts</literal> and <literal>IDx</literal>.
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> is omitted, all the convexes will be considered
    (equivalent to <literal>CVIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max cvid')</literal>). <literal>IDx</literal> is a
    vector, length(IDx) = length(CVIDs)+1. <literal>Pts</literal> is a
    vector containing the concatenated list of points
    of each convex in <literal>CVIDs</literal>. Each entry of <literal>IDx</literal> is the position
    of the corresponding convex point list in <literal>Pts</literal>. Hence, for
    example, the list of points of the second convex is
    Pts(:,IDx(2):IDx(3)-1).
    
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> contains convex #id which do not exist in the mesh,
    their point list will be empty.


  ``CVid = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'cvid')``

    Return the list of all convex #id.
    
    Note that their numbering is not supposed to be contiguous from
    1 to gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'nbcvs'),
    especially if some points have been removed from the mesh. You
    can use gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'optimize_structure') to enforce a contiguous
    numbering. 


  ``m = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max pid')``

    Return the maximum #id of all points in the mesh (see 'max cvid').


  ``m = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max cvid')``

    Return the maximum #id of all convexes in the mesh (see 'max pid').


  ``[E,C] = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'edges' [, CVLST][, 'merge'])``

    [OBSOLETE FUNCTION! will be removed in a future release]
    
    Return the list of edges of mesh M for the convexes listed in the
    row vector CVLST. E is a 2 x nb_edges matrix containing point
    indices. If CVLST is omitted, then the edges of all convexes are
    returned. If CVLST has two rows then the first row is supposed to
    contain convex numbers, and the second face numbers, of which the
    edges will be returned.  If 'merge' is indicated, all common
    edges of convexes are merged in a single edge.  If the optional
    output argument C is specified, it will contain the convex number
    associated with each edge.


  ``[E,C] = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'curved edges', int N [, CVLST])``

    [OBSOLETE FUNCTION! will be removed in a future release]
    
    Return E and C.
    More sophisticated version of gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'edges') designed for
    curved elements. This one will return N (N>=2) points of the
    (curved) edges. With N==2, this is equivalent to
    gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'edges'). Since the points are no more always part of
    the mesh, their coordinates are returned instead of points
    number, in the array E which is a [ mesh_dim x 2 x nb_edges ]
    array.  If the optional output argument C is specified, it will
    contain the convex number associated with each edge.


  ``PIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'orphaned pid')``

    Return point #id which are not linked to a convex.


  ``CVIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'cvid from pid', ivec PIDs[, bool share=False])``

    Return convex #ids related with the point #ids given in <literal>PIDs</literal>.
    
    If <literal>share=False</literal>, search convex whose vertex #ids are in <literal>PIDs</literal>.
    If <literal>share=True</literal>, search convex #ids that share the point #ids
    given in <literal>PIDs</literal>. <literal>CVIDs</literal> is a  vector (possibly
    empty).


  ``CVFIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'faces from pid', ivec PIDs)``

    Return the convex faces whose vertex #ids are in <literal>PIDs</literal>.
    
    <literal>CVFIDs</literal> is a two-rows matrix, the first row lists convex #ids,
    and the second lists face numbers (local number in the convex).
    For a convex face to be returned, EACH of its points have to be
    listed in <literal>PIDs</literal>.


  ``CVFIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'outer faces'[, dim][, CVIDs])``

    Return the set of faces not shared by two elements.
    
    The output <literal>CVFIDs</literal> is a two-rows matrix, the first row lists
    convex #ids, and the second one lists face numbers (local number
    in the convex). If <literal>dim</literal> is provided, the function is forced to
    detect faces of elements that have dimension <literal>dim</literal>, e.g. <literal>dim</literal>=2 will
    detect edges of surface elements, even if these belong to a 3D mesh.
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> is not given, all convexes are considered, and the
    function basically returns the mesh boundary. If <literal>CVIDs</literal>
    is given, it returns the boundary of the convex set whose #ids are
    listed in <literal>CVIDs</literal>.


  ``CVFIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'inner faces'[, CVIDs])``

    Return the set of faces shared at least by two elements in CVIDs.
    Each face is represented only once and is arbitrarily chosen
    between the two neighbor elements.


  ``CVFIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'all faces'[, CVIDs])``

    Return the set of faces of the in CVIDs (in all the mesh if CVIDs is
    omitted). Note that the face shared by two neighbor elements will be
    represented twice.


  ``CVFIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'outer faces with direction', vec v, scalar angle[, dim][, CVIDs])``

    Return the set of faces not shared by two convexes and with a mean outward vector lying within an angle <literal>angle</literal> (in radians) from vector <literal>v</literal>.
    
    The output <literal>CVFIDs</literal> is a two-rows matrix, the first row lists convex
    #ids, and the second one lists face numbers (local number in the
    convex). The argument <literal>dim</literal> works as in outer_faces().
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> is given, it returns portion of the boundary of
    the convex set defined by the #ids listed in <literal>CVIDs</literal>.


  ``CVFIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'outer faces in box', vec pmin, vec pmax[, dim][, CVIDs])``

    Return the set of faces not shared by two convexes and lying within the box defined by the corner points <literal>pmin</literal> and <literal>pmax</literal>.
    
    The output <literal>CVFIDs</literal> is a two-rows matrix, the first row lists convex
    #ids, and the second one lists face numbers (local number in the
    convex). The argument <literal>dim</literal> works as in outer_faces().
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> is given, it returns portion of the boundary of
    the convex set defined by the #ids listed in <literal>CVIDs</literal>.


  ``CVFIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'outer faces in ball', vec center, scalar radius[, dim][, CVIDs])``

    Return the set of faces not shared by two convexes and lying within the ball of corresponding <literal>center</literal> and <literal>radius</literal>.
    
    The output <literal>CVFIDs</literal> is a two-rows matrix, the first row lists convex
    #ids, and the second one lists face numbers (local number in the
    convex). The argument <literal>dim</literal> works as in outer_faces().
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> is given, it returns portion of the boundary of
    the convex set defined by the #ids listed in <literal>CVIDs</literal>.


  ``CVFIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'adjacent face', int cvid, int fid)``

    Return convex face of the neighbor element if it exists.
    If the convex have more than one neighbor
    relatively to the face <literal></literal>f<literal></literal> (think to bar elements in 3D for instance),
    return the first face found.


  ``CVFIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'faces from cvid'[, ivec CVIDs][, 'merge'])``

    Return a list of convex faces from a list of convex #id.
    
    <literal>CVFIDs</literal> is a two-rows matrix, the first row lists convex #ids,
    and the second lists face numbers (local number in the convex).
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> is not given, all convexes are considered. The optional
    argument 'merge' merges faces shared by the convex of <literal>CVIDs</literal>.


  ``[mat T] = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'triangulated surface', int Nrefine [,CVLIST])``

    [DEPRECATED FUNCTION! will be removed in a future release]
    
    Similar function to gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'curved edges') : split (if
    necessary, i.e. if the geometric transformation if non-linear)
    each face into sub-triangles and return their coordinates in T
    (see also gf_compute('eval on P1 tri mesh'))

    Return the normal vector of convex <literal>cv</literal>, face <literal>f</literal> at the <literal>nfpt</literal> point of the face.
    
    If <literal>nfpt</literal> is not specified, then the normal is evaluated at each
    geometrical node of the face.


  ``N = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'normal of faces', imat CVFIDs)``

    Return matrix of (at face centers) the normal vectors of convexes.
    
    <literal>CVFIDs</literal> is supposed a two-rows matrix, the first row lists convex
    #ids, and the second lists face numbers (local number in the convex).


  ``CVIDs = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'convexes in box', vec pmin, vec pmax)``

    indice in <literal>CVIDs</literal> to the indice of its structure in <literal>S</literal>.


  ``{GT, CV2GT} = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'geotrans'[, ivec CVIDs])``

**Description :**


  General function for modification of a mesh object.


**Command list :**



  ``PIDs = gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'pts', mat PTS)``

    Replace the coordinates of the mesh points with those given in <literal>PTS</literal>.


  ``PIDs = gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'add point', mat PTS)``

    Insert new points in the mesh and return their #ids.
    
    <literal>PTS</literal> should be an <literal></literal>nxm<literal></literal> matrix , where <literal></literal>n<literal></literal> is the mesh
    dimension, and <literal></literal>m<literal></literal> is the number of points that will be
    added to the mesh. On output, <literal>PIDs</literal> contains the point #ids
    of these new points.
    
    Remark: if some points are already part of the mesh (with a small
    tolerance of approximately <literal></literal>1e-8<literal></literal>), they won't be inserted again,
    and <literal>PIDs</literal> will contain the previously assigned #ids of these
    points.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'del point', ivec PIDs)``

    Removes one or more points from the mesh.
    
    <literal>PIDs</literal> should contain the point #ids, such as the one returned by
    the 'add point' command.


  ``CVIDs = gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'add convex', geotrans GT, mat PTS)``

    Add a new convex into the mesh.
    
    The convex structure (triangle, prism,...) is given by <literal>GT</literal>
    (obtained with gf_geotrans('...')), and its points are given by
    the columns of <literal>PTS</literal>. On return, <literal>CVIDs</literal> contains the convex #ids.
    <literal>PTS</literal> might be a 3-dimensional array in order to insert more than
    one convex (or a two dimensional array correctly shaped according
    to Fortran ordering).


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'del convex', mat CVIDs)``

    Remove one or more convexes from the mesh.
    
    <literal>CVIDs</literal> should contain the convexes #ids, such as the ones
    returned by the 'add convex' command.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'del convex of dim', ivec DIMs)``

    Remove all convexes of dimension listed in <literal>DIMs</literal>.
    
    For example; <literal></literal>gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'del convex of dim', [1,2])<literal></literal> remove
    all line segments, triangles and quadrangles.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'translate', vec V)``

    Translates each point of the mesh with the vector <literal>V</literal>.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'transform', mat T)``

    Applies the transformation matrix <literal>T</literal> to each point of the mesh.
    
    Note that <literal>T</literal> is not required to be a <literal></literal>NxN<literal></literal> matrix (with
    <literal></literal>N = gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'dim')<literal></literal>). Hence it is possible to transform
    a 2D mesh into a 3D one (and reciprocally).


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'boundary', int rnum, mat CVFIDs)``

    DEPRECATED FUNCTION. Use 'region' instead.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'region', int rnum, mat CVFIDs)``

    Assigns the region number <literal>rnum</literal> to the set of convexes or/and convex
    faces provided in the matrix <literal>CVFIDs</literal>.
    
    The first row of <literal>CVFIDs</literal> contains convex #ids, and the second row
    contains a face number in the convex (or 0
    for the whole convex (regions are usually used to store a list of
    convex faces, but you may also use them to store a list of convexes).
    
    If a vector is provided (or a one row matrix) the region will represent
    the corresponding set of convex.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'extend region', int rnum, mat CVFIDs)``

    Extends the region identified by the region number <literal>rnum</literal> to include
    the set of convexes or/and convex faces provided in the matrix
    <literal>CVFIDs</literal>, see also <literal></literal>gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'set region)<literal></literal>.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'region intersect', int r1, int r2)``

    Replace the region number <literal>r1</literal> with its intersection with region number <literal>r2</literal>.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'region merge', int r1, int r2)``

    Merge region number <literal>r2</literal> into region number <literal>r1</literal>.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'region subtract', int r1, int r2)``

    Replace the region number <literal>r1</literal> with its difference with region
    number <literal>r2</literal>.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'delete boundary', int rnum, mat CVFIDs)``

    DEPRECATED FUNCTION. Use 'delete region' instead.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'delete region', ivec RIDs)``

    Remove the regions whose #ids are listed in <literal>RIDs</literal>.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'merge', mesh m2[, scalar  tol])``

    Merge with the mesh <literal>m2</literal>.
    
    Overlapping points, within a tolerance radius <literal>tol</literal>, will not be
    duplicated. If <literal>m2</literal> is a mesh_fem object, its linked mesh will be used.


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'optimize structure'[, int with_renumbering])``

    Reset point and convex numbering.
    
    After optimisation, the points (resp. convexes) will
    be consecutively numbered from 1 to gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max pid')
    (resp. gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max cvid')).


  ``gf_mesh_set(mesh M, 'refine'[, ivec CVIDs])``

    Use a Bank strategy for mesh refinement.
    
    If <literal>CVIDs</literal> is not given, the whole mesh is refined. Note
    that the regions, and the finite element methods and
    integration methods of the mesh_fem and mesh_im objects linked
    to this mesh will be automagically refined.

**Description :**


  General function for inquiry about mesh_fem objects.


**Command list :**



  ``n = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'nbdof')``

    Return the number of degrees of freedom (dof) of the mesh_fem.


  ``n = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'nb basic dof')``

    Return the number of basic degrees of freedom (dof) of the mesh_fem.


  ``DOF = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'dof from cv',mat CVids)``

    Deprecated function. Use gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'basic dof from cv') instead. 


  ``DOF = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'basic dof from cv',mat CVids)``

    Return the dof of the convexes listed in <literal>CVids</literal>.
    
    WARNING: the degrees of freedom might be returned in ANY order, do
    not use this function in your assembly routines. Use 'basic dof from cvid'
    instead, if you want to be able to map a convex number with its
    associated degrees of freedom.
    
    One can also get the list of basic dof on a set on convex faces, by
    indicating on the second row of <literal>CVids</literal> the faces numbers (with
    respect to the convex number on the first row).


  ``{DOFs, IDx} = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'dof from cvid'[, mat CVids])``

    Deprecated function. Use gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'basic dof from cvid') instead.


  ``{DOFs, IDx} = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'basic dof from cvid'[, mat CVids])``

    Return the degrees of freedom attached to each convex of the mesh.
    
    If <literal>CVids</literal> is omitted, all the convexes will be considered (equivalent
    to <literal>CVids = 1 ... gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max cvid')</literal>).
    
    <literal>IDx</literal> is a vector, <literal>length(IDx) = length(CVids)+1</literal>.
    <literal>DOFs</literal> is a vector containing the concatenated list
    of dof of each convex in <literal>CVids</literal>. Each entry of <literal>IDx</literal> is the position
    of the corresponding convex point list in <literal>DOFs</literal>. Hence, for example,
    the list of points of the second convex is DOFs(IDx(2):IDx(3)-1).
    
    If <literal>CVids</literal> contains convex #id which do not exist in the mesh, their
    point list will be empty.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'non conformal dof'[, mat CVids])``

    Deprecated function. Use gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'non conformal basic dof') instead.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'non conformal basic dof'[, mat CVids])``

    Return partially linked degrees of freedom.
    
    Return the basic dof located on the border of a convex and which belong
    to only one convex, except the ones which are located on the border
    of the mesh.  For example, if the convex 'a' and 'b' share a common
    face, 'a' has a P1 FEM, and 'b' has a P2 FEM, then the basic dof on the
    middle of the face will be returned by this function (this can be
    useful when searching the interfaces between classical FEM and
    hierarchical FEM).


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'qdim')``

    Return the dimension Q of the field interpolated by the mesh_fem.
    
    By default, Q=1 (scalar field). This has an impact on the dof numbering.


  ``{FEMs, CV2F} = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'fem'[, mat CVids])``

    Return a list of FEM used by the mesh_fem.
    
    <literal>FEMs</literal> is an array of all fem objects found in the convexes
    given in <literal>CVids</literal>. If <literal>CV2F</literal> was supplied as an output argument,
    it contains, for each convex listed in <literal>CVids</literal>, the index of its
    correspounding FEM in <literal>FEMs</literal>.
    
    Convexes which are not part of the mesh, or convexes which do not
    have any FEM have their correspounding entry in <literal>CV2F</literal> set to -1.
    


  ``CVs = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'convex_index')``

    Return the list of convexes who have an FEM.


  ``bB = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'is_lagrangian'[, mat CVids])``

    Test if the mesh_fem is Lagrangian.
    
    Lagrangian means that each base function Phi[i] is such that
    Phi[i](P[j]) = delta(i,j), where P[j] is the dof location of
    the jth base function, and delta(i,j) = 1 if i==j, else 0.
    
    If <literal>CVids</literal> is omitted, it returns 1 if all convexes in the mesh
    are Lagrangian. If <literal>CVids</literal> is used, it returns the convex indices
    (with respect to <literal>CVids</literal>) which are Lagrangian.


  ``bB = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'is_equivalent'[, mat CVids])``

    Test if the mesh_fem is equivalent.
    
    See gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'is_lagrangian')


  ``bB = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'is_polynomial'[, mat CVids])``

    Test if all base functions are polynomials.
    
    See gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'is_lagrangian')


  ``bB = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'is_reduced')``

    Return 1 if the optional reduction matrix is applied to the dofs.


  ``bB = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'reduction matrix')``

    Return the optional reduction matrix.


  ``bB = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'extension matrix')``

    Return the optional extension matrix.


  ``Vr = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'reduce vector', vec V)``

    Multiply the provided vector V with the extension matrix of the mesh_fem.


  ``Ve = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'extend vector', vec V)``

    Multiply the provided vector V with the reduction matrix of the mesh_fem.


  ``DOFs = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'basic dof on region',mat Rs)``

    Return the list of basic dof (before the optional reduction) lying on one
    of the mesh regions listed in <literal>Rs</literal>.
    
    More precisely, this function returns the basic dof whose support is
    non-null on one of regions whose #ids are listed in <literal>Rs</literal> (note
    that for boundary regions, some dof nodes may not lie exactly
    on the boundary, for example the dof of Pk(n,0) lies on the center
    of the convex, but the base function in not null on the convex
    border).


  ``DOFs = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'dof on region',mat Rs)``

    Return the list of dof (after the optional reduction) lying on one
    of the mesh regions listed in <literal>Rs</literal>.
    
    More precisely, this function returns the basic dof whose support is
    non-null on one of regions whose #ids are listed in <literal>Rs</literal> (note
    that for boundary regions, some dof nodes may not lie exactly
    on the boundary, for example the dof of Pk(n,0) lies on the center
    of the convex, but the base function in not null on the convex
    border).
    
    For a reduced mesh_fem
    a dof is lying on a region if its potential corresponding shape
    function is nonzero on this region. The extension matrix is used
    to make the correspondence between basic and reduced dofs.


  ``DOFpts = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'dof nodes'[, mat DOFids])``

    Deprecated function. Use gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'basic dof nodes') instead.


  ``DOFpts = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'basic dof nodes'[, mat DOFids])``

    Get location of basic degrees of freedom.
    
    Return the list of interpolation points for the specified
    dof #IDs in <literal>DOFids</literal> (if <literal>DOFids</literal> is omitted, all basic dof are
    considered).


  ``DOFP = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'dof partition')``

    Get the 'dof_partition' array.
    
    Return the array which associates an integer (the partition number)
    to each convex of the mesh_fem. By default, it is an all-zero array.
    The degrees of freedom of each convex of the mesh_fem are connected
    only to the dof of neighboring convexes which have the same
    partition number, hence it is possible to create partially
    discontinuous mesh_fem very easily.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'save',string filename[, string opt])``

    Save a mesh_fem in a text file (and optionally its linked mesh object
    if <literal>opt</literal> is the string 'with_mesh').


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'char'[, string opt])``

    Output a string description of the mesh_fem.
    
    By default, it does not include the description of the linked mesh
    object, except if <literal>opt</literal> is 'with_mesh'.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'display')``

    displays a short summary for a mesh_fem object.


  ``m = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'linked mesh')``

    Return a reference to the mesh object linked to <literal>mf</literal>.


  ``m = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'mesh')``

    Return a reference to the mesh object linked to <literal>mf</literal>.
    (identical to gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'linked mesh'))


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'export to vtk',string filename, ... ['ascii'], U, 'name'...)``

    Export a mesh_fem and some fields to a vtk file.
    
    The FEM and geometric transformations will be mapped to order 1
    or 2 isoparametric Pk (or Qk) FEMs (as VTK does not handle higher
    order elements). If you need to represent high-order FEMs or
    high-order geometric transformations, you should consider
    gf_slice_get(slice S, 'export to vtk').


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'export to vtu',string filename, ... ['ascii'], U, 'name'...)``

    Export a mesh_fem and some fields to a vtu file.
    
    The FEM and geometric transformations will be mapped to order 1
    or 2 isoparametric Pk (or Qk) FEMs (as VTK(XML) does not handle higher
    order elements). If you need to represent high-order FEMs or
    high-order geometric transformations, you should consider
    gf_slice_get(slice S, 'export to vtu').


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'export to dx',string filename, ...['as', string mesh_name][,'edges']['serie',string serie_name][,'ascii'][,'append'], U, 'name'...)``

    Export a mesh_fem and some fields to an OpenDX file.
    
    This function will fail if the mesh_fem mixes different convex types
    (i.e. quads and triangles), or if OpenDX does not handle a specific
    element type (i.e. prism connections are not known by OpenDX).
    
    The FEM will be mapped to order 1 Pk (or Qk) FEMs. If you need to
    represent high-order FEMs or high-order geometric transformations,
    you should consider gf_slice_get(slice S, 'export to dx').


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'export to pos',string filename[, string name][[,mesh_fem mf1], mat U1, string nameU1[[,mesh_fem mf2], mat U2, string nameU2,...]])``

    Export a mesh_fem and some fields to a pos file.
    
    The FEM and geometric transformations will be mapped to order 1
    isoparametric Pk (or Qk) FEMs (as GMSH does not handle higher
    order elements).


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'dof_from_im',mesh_im mim[, int p])``

    Return a selection of dof who contribute significantly to the
    mass-matrix that would be computed with <literal>mf</literal> and the integration
    method <literal>mim</literal>.
    
    <literal>p</literal> represents the dimension on what the integration method
    operates (default <literal>p = mesh dimension</literal>).
    
    IMPORTANT: you still have to set a valid integration method on
    the convexes which are not crosses by the levelset!


  ``U = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'interpolate_convex_data',mat Ucv)``

    Interpolate data given on each convex of the mesh to the mesh_fem dof.
    The mesh_fem has to be lagrangian, and should be discontinuous (typically
    an FEM_PK(N,0) or FEM_QK(N,0) should be used).
    
    The last dimension of the input vector Ucv should have
    gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max cvid') elements.
    
    Example of use: gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'interpolate_convex_data', gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'quality'))


  ``z = gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'memsize')``

    Return the amount of memory (in bytes) used by the mesh_fem object.
    
    The result does not take into account the linked mesh object.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'has_linked_mesh_levelset')``

    Is a mesh_fem_level_set or not.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'linked_mesh_levelset')``

    if it is a mesh_fem_level_set gives the linked mesh_level_set.

**Description :**


  General function for modifying mesh_fem objects.
  

**Command list :**



  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'fem', fem f[, ivec CVids])``

    Set the Finite Element Method.
    
    Assign an FEM <literal>f</literal> to all convexes whose #ids are listed in <literal>CVids</literal>.
    If <literal>CVids</literal> is not given, the integration is assigned to all convexes.
    
    See the help of gf_fem to obtain a list of available FEM methods.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'classical fem', int k[[, 'complete'], ivec CVids])``

    Assign a classical (Lagrange polynomial) fem of order <literal>k</literal> to the mesh_fem.
    The option 'complete' requests complete Langrange polynomial elements,
    even if the element geometric transformation is an incomplete one
    (e.g. 8-node quadrilateral or 20-node hexahedral).
    
    Uses FEM_PK for simplexes, FEM_QK for parallelepipeds etc.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'classical discontinuous fem', int k[[, 'complete'], @tscalar alpha[, ivec CVIDX]])``

    Assigns a classical (Lagrange polynomial) discontinuous fem of order k.
    
    Similar to gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'set classical fem') except that
    FEM_PK_DISCONTINUOUS is used. Param <literal>alpha</literal> the node inset,
    <latex style="text"><![CDATA[0 \leq alpha < 1]]></latex>, where 0 implies usual dof nodes, greater values
    move the nodes toward the center of gravity, and 1 means that all
    degrees of freedom collapse on the center of gravity.
    The option 'complete' requests complete Langrange polynomial elements,
    even if the element geometric transformation is an incomplete one
    (e.g. 8-node quadrilateral or 20-node hexahedral).


  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'qdim', int Q)``

    Change the <literal>Q</literal> dimension of the field that is interpolated by the mesh_fem.
    
    <literal>Q = 1</literal> means that the mesh_fem describes a scalar field, <literal>Q = N</literal> means
    that the mesh_fem describes a vector field of dimension N.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'reduction matrices', mat R, mat E)``

    Set the reduction and extension matrices and valid their use.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'reduction', int s)``

    Set or unset the use of the reduction/extension matrices.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'reduce meshfem', mat RM)``

    Set reduction mesh fem
    This function selects the degrees of freedom of the finite element
    method by selecting a set of independent vectors of the matrix RM.
    The number of columns of RM should correspond to the number of degrees
    of freedom of the finite element method.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'dof partition', ivec DOFP)``

    Change the 'dof_partition' array.
    
    <literal>DOFP</literal> is a vector holding a integer value for each convex of the mesh_fem.
    See gf_mesh_fem_get(mesh_fem MF, 'dof partition') for a description of "dof partition".


  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'set partial', ivec DOFs[, ivec RCVs])``

    Can only be applied to a partial mesh_fem. Change the subset of the
    degrees of freedom of <literal>mf</literal>.
    
    If <literal>RCVs</literal> is given, no FEM will be put on the convexes listed
    in <literal>RCVs</literal>.


  ``gf_mesh_fem_set(mesh_fem MF, 'adapt')``

    For a mesh_fem levelset object only. Adapt the mesh_fem object to a
    change of the levelset function.

gf_mesh_im
-------------------------------------------

**Synopsis**

::

  MIM = gf_mesh_im('load', string fname[, mesh m])
  MIM = gf_mesh_im('from string', string s[, mesh m])
  MIM = gf_mesh_im('clone', mesh_im mim)
  MIM = gf_mesh_im('levelset', mesh_levelset mls, string where, integ im[, integ im_tip[, integ im_set]])
  MIM = gf_mesh_im(mesh m, [{integ im|int im_degree}])

**Description :**


General constructor for mesh_im objects.

  This object represents an integration method defined on a whole mesh (and
  potentially on its boundaries).


**Command list :**



  ``MIM = gf_mesh_im('load', string fname[, mesh m])``

    Load a mesh_im from a file.
    
    If the mesh <literal>m</literal> is not supplied (this kind of file does not store the
    mesh), then it is read from the file and its descriptor is returned as
    the second output argument.


  ``MIM = gf_mesh_im('from string', string s[, mesh m])``

    Create a mesh_im object from its string description.
    
    See also <literal></literal>gf_mesh_im_get(mesh_im MI, 'char')<literal></literal>


  ``MIM = gf_mesh_im('clone', mesh_im mim)``

    Create a copy of a mesh_im.


  ``MIM = gf_mesh_im('levelset', mesh_levelset mls, string where, integ im[, integ im_tip[, integ im_set]])``

    Build an integration method conformal to a partition defined
    implicitly by a levelset.
    
    The <literal>where</literal> argument defines the domain of integration with respect to
    the levelset, it has to be chosen among 'ALL', 'INSIDE', 'OUTSIDE' and
    'BOUNDARY'.
    
    It can be completed by a string defining the boolean operation
    to define the integration domain when there is more than one levelset.
    
    The syntax is very simple, for example if there are 3 different
    levelsets,
    
     "a*b*c" is the intersection of the domains defined by each
     levelset (this is the default behaviour if this function is not
     called).
    
     "a+b+c" is the union of their domains.
    
     "c-(a+b)" is the domain of the third levelset minus the union of
     the domains of the two others.
    
     "!a" is the complementary of the domain of a (i.e. it is the
     domain where a(x)>0)
    
    The first levelset is always referred to with "a", the second
    with "b", and so on.
    
     for intance INSIDE(a*b*c)
    
    CAUTION: this integration method will be defined only on elements
    cut by the level-set. For the 'ALL', 'INSIDE' and 'OUTSIDE' options
    it is mandatory to use the method <literal></literal>gf_mesh_im_set(mesh_im MI, 'integ')<literal></literal> to define
    the integration method on the remaining elements.


  ``MIM = gf_mesh_im(mesh m, [{integ im|int im_degree}])``

    Build a new mesh_im object.
    
    For convenience, optional arguments (<literal>im</literal> or <literal>im_degree</literal>) can be
    provided, in that case a call to <literal></literal>gf_mesh_im_get(mesh_im MI, 'integ')<literal></literal> is issued
    with these arguments.

    Return a list of integration methods used by the mesh_im.
    
    <literal>I</literal> is an array of all integ objects found in the convexes
    given in <literal>CVids</literal>. If <literal>CV2I</literal> was supplied as an output argument, it
    contains, for each convex listed in <literal>CVids</literal>, the index of its
    correspounding integration method in <literal>I</literal>.
    
    Convexes which are not part of the mesh, or convexes which do
    not have any integration method have their correspounding entry
    in <literal>CV2I</literal> set to -1.
    
    


  ``CVids = gf_mesh_im_get(mesh_im MI, 'convex_index')``

    Return the list of convexes who have a integration method.

    Return the elementary matrix (or tensor) integrated on the convex <literal>cv</literal>.
    
    **WARNING**
    
    Be sure that the fem used for the construction of <literal>em</literal> is compatible
    with the fem assigned to element <literal>cv</literal> ! This is not checked by the
    function ! If the argument <literal>f</literal> is given, then the elementary tensor
    is integrated on the face <literal>f</literal> of <literal>cv</literal> instead of the whole convex.


  ``Ip = gf_mesh_im_get(mesh_im MI, 'im_nodes'[, mat CVids])``

    Return the coordinates of the integration points, with their weights.
    
    <literal>CVids</literal> may be a list of convexes, or a list of convex faces, such
    as returned by gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'region')
    
    **WARNING**
    
    Convexes which are not part of the mesh, or convexes which
    do not have an approximate integration method do not have
    their corresponding entry (this has no meaning for exact
    integration methods!).


  ``gf_mesh_im_get(mesh_im MI, 'save',string filename[, 'with mesh'])``

    Saves a mesh_im in a text file (and optionally its linked mesh object).


  ``gf_mesh_im_get(mesh_im MI, 'char'[,'with mesh'])``

      solve the problem only with respect to a subset of variables (the
      disabled variables are then considered as data) for instance to
      replace the global Newton strategy with a fixed point one.

    (useful to test newly created bricks).
    The increment is only made on variable <literal>varname2</literal> and tested on the
    part of the residual corresponding to <literal>varname1</literal>. This means that
    only the term (<literal>varname1</literal>, <literal>varname2</literal>) of the tangent matrix is tested.

    depends on the law. It could be a short vector of constant values or a
    vector field described on a finite element method for variable coefficients.

  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add linear term', mesh_im mim, string expression[, int region[, int is_symmetric[, int is_coercive]]])``

    Adds a matrix term given by the assembly string <literal>expr</literal> which will
    be assembled in region <literal>region</literal> and with the integration method <literal>mim</literal>.
    Only the matrix term will be taken into account, assuming that it is
    linear.
    The advantage of declaring a term linear instead of nonlinear is that
    it will be assembled only once and no assembly is necessary for the
    residual.
    Take care that if the expression contains some variables and if the
    expression is a potential or of first order (i.e. describe the weak
    form, not the derivative of the weak form), the expression will be
    derivated with respect to all variables.
    You can specify if the term is symmetric, coercive or not.
    If you are not sure, the better is to declare the term not symmetric
    and not coercive. But some solvers (conjugate gradient for instance)
    are not allowed for non-coercive problems.
    <literal>brickname</literal> is an optional name for the brick.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add linear twodomain term', mesh_im mim, string expression, int region, string secondary_domain[, int is_symmetric[, int is_coercive]])``

    and a second one by <literal></literal>secondary_domain<literal></literal> which has to be declared
    first into the model.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add linear generic assembly brick', mesh_im mim, string expression[, int region[, int is_symmetric[, int is_coercive]]])``

    Adds a nonlinear term given by the assembly string <literal>expr</literal> which will
    be assembled in region <literal>region</literal> and with the integration method <literal>mim</literal>.
    The expression can describe a potential or a weak form. Second order
    terms (i.e. containing second order test functions, Test2) are not
    allowed.
    You can specify if the term is symmetric, coercive or not.
    If you are not sure, the better is to declare the term not symmetric
    and not coercive. But some solvers (conjugate gradient for instance)
    are not allowed for non-coercive problems.
    <literal>brickname</literal> is an optional name for the brick.

    first into the model.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add nonlinear generic assembly brick', mesh_im mim, string expression[, int region[, int is_symmetric[, int is_coercive]]])``

  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add source term', mesh_im mim, string expression[, int region])``

    Adds a source term given by the assembly string <literal>expr</literal> which will
    be assembled in region <literal>region</literal> and with the integration method <literal>mim</literal>.
    Only the residual term will be taken into account.
    Take care that if the expression contains some variables and if the
    expression is a potential, the expression will be
    derivated with respect to all variables.
    <literal>brickname</literal> is an optional name for the brick.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add twodomain source term', mesh_im mim, string expression, int region, string secondary_domain)``

    Deprecated. Use gf_model_set(model M, 'add source term') instead.


  ``gf_model_set(model M, 'add assembly assignment', string dataname, string expression[, int region[, int order[, int before]]])``

    Adds expression <literal>expr</literal> to be evaluated at assembly time and being
    assigned to the data <literal>dataname</literal> which has to be of im_data type.
    This allows for instance to store a sub-expression of an assembly
    computation to be used on an other assembly. It can be used for instance
    to store the plastic strain in plasticity models.
    <literal>order</literal> represents the order of assembly where this assignement has to be
    done (potential(0), weak form(1) or tangent system(2) or at each
    order(-1)). The default value is 1.
    If before = 1, the the assignement is perfromed before the computation
    of the other assembly terms, such that the data can be used in the
    remaining of the assembly as an intermediary result (be careful that it is
    still considered as a data, no derivation of the expression is performed
    for the tangent system).
    If before = 0 (default), the assignement is done after the assembly
    terms.


  ``gf_model_set(model M, 'clear assembly assignment')``

    Add a Laplacian term to the model relatively to the variable <literal>varname</literal>
    (in fact with a minus : <latex style="text"><![CDATA[-\text{div}(\nabla u)]]></latex>).
    If this is a vector valued variable, the Laplacian term is added
    componentwise. <literal>region</literal> is an optional mesh region on which the term
    is added. If it is not specified, it is added on the whole mesh. Return
    the brick index in the model.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add generic elliptic brick', mesh_im mim, string varname, string dataname[, int region])``

    Add a generic elliptic term to the model relatively to the variable <literal>varname</literal>.
    The shape of the elliptic term depends both on the variable and the data.
    This corresponds to a term
    <latex style="text"><![CDATA[-\text{div}(a\nabla u)]]></latex>
    where <latex style="text"><![CDATA[a]]></latex> is the data and <latex style="text"><![CDATA[u]]></latex> the variable. The data can be
    a scalar,
    a matrix or an order four tensor. The variable can be vector valued or
    not. If the data is a scalar or a matrix and the variable is vector
    valued then the term is added componentwise. An order four tensor data
    is allowed for vector valued variable only. The data can be constant or
    describbed on a fem. Of course, when the data is a tensor describe on a
    finite element method (a tensor field) the data can be a huge vector.
    The components of the matrix/tensor have to be stored with the fortran
    order (columnwise) in the data vector (compatibility with blas). The
    symmetry of the given matrix/tensor is not verified (but assumed). If
    this is a vector valued variable, the elliptic term is added
    componentwise. <literal>region</literal> is an optional mesh region on which the term is
    added. If it is not specified, it is added on the whole mesh. Note that
    for the real
    version which uses the high-level generic assembly language, <literal>dataname</literal>
    can be any regular expression of the high-level generic assembly
    language (like "1", "sin(X(1))" or "Norm(u)" for instance) even
    depending on model variables. Return the
    brick index in the model.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add source term brick', mesh_im mim, string varname, string dataexpr[, int region[, string directdataname]])``

    Add a source term to the model relatively to the variable <literal>varname</literal>.
    The source term is
    represented by <literal>dataexpr</literal> which could be any regular expression of the
    high-level generic assembly language (except for the complex version
    where it has to be a declared data of the model).
    <literal>region</literal> is an optional mesh region
    on which the term is added. An additional optional data <literal>directdataname</literal>
    can be provided. The corresponding data vector will be directly added
    to the right hand side without assembly. Note that when region is a
    boundary, this brick allows to prescribe a nonzero Neumann boundary
    condition. Return the brick index in the model.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add normal source term brick', mesh_im mim, string varname, string dataname, int region)``

    Add a source term on the variable <literal>varname</literal> on a boundary <literal>region</literal>.

    represented by the data <literal>dataepxpr</literal> which could be any regular
    expression of the high-level generic assembly language (except
    for the complex version where it has to be a declared data of
    the model). A scalar
    product with the outward normal unit vector to the boundary is performed.
    The main aim of this brick is to represent a Neumann condition with a
    vector data without performing the scalar product with the normal as a
    pre-processing. Return the brick index in the model.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add Dirichlet condition with simplification', string varname, int region[, string dataname])``

    Adds a (simple) Dirichlet condition on the variable <literal>varname</literal> and
    the mesh region <literal>region</literal>. The Dirichlet condition is prescribed by
    a simple post-treatment of the final linear system (tangent system
    for nonlinear problems) consisting of modifying the lines corresponding
    to the degree of freedom of the variable on <literal>region</literal> (0 outside the
    diagonal, 1 on the diagonal of the matrix and the expected value on
    the right hand side).
    The symmetry of the linear system is kept if all other bricks are
    symmetric.
    This brick is to be reserved for simple Dirichlet conditions (only dof
    declared on the corresponding boundary are prescribed). The application
    of this brick on reduced dof may be problematic. Intrinsic vectorial
    finite element method are not supported.
    <literal>dataname</literal> is the optional right hand side of  the Dirichlet condition.
    It could be constant (but in that case, it can only be applied to
    Lagrange f.e.m.) or (important) described on the same finite
    element method as <literal>varname</literal>.

    to be the variable name corresponding to the multiplier (which should be
    first declared as a multiplier variable on the mesh region in the model).
    If it is a finite element method (mesh_fem object) then a multiplier
    variable will be added to the model and build on this finite element
    method (it will be restricted to the mesh region <literal>region</literal> and eventually
    some conflicting dofs with some other multiplier variables will be
    suppressed). If it is an integer, then a  multiplier variable will be
    added to the model and build on a classical finite element of degree
    that integer. <literal>dataname</literal> is the optional right hand side of  the
    Dirichlet condition. It could be constant or described on a fem; scalar
    or vector valued, depending on the variable on which the Dirichlet
    condition is prescribed. Return the brick index in the model.

    described as an expression of the high-level
    generic assembly language. This term can be obtained by

    been added to the model. The Dirichlet
    condition is prescribed with Nitsche's method. <literal>datag</literal> is the optional
    right hand side of the Dirichlet condition. <literal>datagamma0</literal> is the
    Nitsche's method parameter. <literal>theta</literal> is a scalar value which can be
    positive or negative. <literal>theta = 1</literal> corresponds to the standard symmetric
    method which is conditionally coercive for  <literal>gamma0</literal> small.
    <literal>theta = -1</literal> corresponds to the skew-symmetric method which is
    inconditionally coercive. <literal>theta = 0</literal> (default) is the simplest method
    for which the second derivative of the Neumann term is not necessary
    even for nonlinear problems. Return the brick index in the model.

    region <literal>region</literal>. This region should be a boundary. The Dirichlet

    If it is a finite element method (mesh_fem object) then a multiplier
    variable will be added to the model and build on this finite element
    method (it will be restricted to the mesh region <literal>region</literal> and eventually

    multiplier <literal>multname</literal>.
    The conditions are prescribed on a set of points given in the data
    <literal>dataname_pt</literal> whose dimension is the number of points times the dimension
    of the mesh.
    The multiplier variable should be a fixed size variable of size the
    number of points.
    If the variable represents a vector field, one has to give the data
    <literal>dataname_unitv</literal> which represents a vector of dimension the number of
    points times the dimension of the vector field which should store some
    unit vectors. In that case the prescribed constraint is the scalar
    product of the variable at the corresponding point with the corresponding
    unit vector.
    The optional data <literal>dataname_val</literal> is the vector of values to be prescribed
    at the different points.

    variable <literal>varname</literal> (deprecated brick, use add_finite_strain_elaticity
    instead). <literal>lawname</literal> is the constitutive law which
    could be 'SaintVenant Kirchhoff', 'Mooney Rivlin', 'neo Hookean',
    'Ciarlet Geymonat' or 'generalized Blatz Ko'.
    'Mooney Rivlin' and 'neo Hookean' law names can be preceded with the word
    'compressible' or 'incompressible' to force using the corresponding version.
    The compressible version of these laws requires one additional material
    coefficient. By default, the incompressible version of 'Mooney Rivlin' law

    IMPORTANT : if the variable is defined on a 2D mesh, the plane strain
    approximation is automatically used.
    <literal>dataname</literal> is a vector of parameters for the constitutive law. Its length

    Add a nonlinear elasticity term to the model relatively to the
    variable <literal>varname</literal>. <literal>lawname</literal> is the constitutive law which
    could be 'SaintVenant Kirchhoff', 'Mooney Rivlin', 'Neo Hookean',
    'Ciarlet Geymonat' or 'Generalized Blatz Ko'.
    'Mooney Rivlin' and 'Neo Hookean' law names have to be preceeded with
    the word 'Compressible' or 'Incompressible' to force using the
    corresponding version.
    The compressible version of these laws requires one additional material
    coefficient.
    
    IMPORTANT : if the variable is defined on a 2D mesh, the plane strain
    approximation is automatically used.
    <literal>params</literal> is a vector of parameters for the constitutive law. Its length
    depends on the law. It could be a short vector of constant values or a
    vector field described on a finite element method for variable
    coefficients. <literal>region</literal> is an optional mesh region on which the term

  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add small strain elastoplasticity brick', mesh_im mim,  string lawname, string unknowns_type [, string varnames, ...] [, string params, ...] [, string theta = '1' [, string dt = 'timestep']] [, int region = -1])``

    Adds a small strain plasticity term to the model <literal>M</literal>. This is the
    main GetFEM brick for small strain plasticity. <literal>lawname</literal> is the name
    of an implemented plastic law, <literal>unknowns_type</literal> indicates the choice
    between a discretization where the plastic multiplier is an unknown of
    the problem or (return mapping approach) just a data of the model
    stored for the next iteration. Remember that in both cases, a multiplier
    is stored anyway. <literal>varnames</literal> is a set of variable and data names with
    length which may depend on the plastic law (at least the displacement,
    the plastic multiplier and the plastic strain). <literal>params</literal> is a list of
    expressions for the parameters (at least elastic coefficients and the
    yield stress). These expressions can be some data names (or even
    variable names) of the model but can also be any scalar valid expression
    of the high level assembly language (such as '1/2', '2+sin(X[0])',
    '1+Norm(v)' ...). The last two parameters optionally provided in
    <literal>params</literal> are the <literal>theta</literal> parameter of the <literal>theta</literal>-scheme (generalized
    trapezoidal rule) used for the plastic strain integration and the
    time-step<literal>dt</literal>. The default value for <literal>theta</literal> if omitted is 1, which
    corresponds to the classical Backward Euler scheme which is first order
    consistent. <literal>theta=1/2</literal> corresponds to the Crank-Nicolson scheme
    (trapezoidal rule) which is second order consistent. Any value
    between 1/2 and 1 should be a valid value. The default value of <literal>dt</literal> is
    'timestep' which simply indicates the time step defined in the model
    (by md.set_time_step(dt)). Alternatively it can be any expression
    (data name, constant value ...). The time step can be altered from one
    iteration to the next one. <literal>region</literal> is a mesh region.
    
    The available plasticity laws are:
    
    - 'Prandtl Reuss' (or 'isotropic perfect plasticity').
      Isotropic elasto-plasticity with no hardening. The variables are the
      displacement, the plastic multiplier and the plastic strain.
      The displacement should be a variable and have a corresponding data
      having the same name preceded by 'Previous\_' corresponding to the
      displacement at the previous time step (typically 'u' and 'Previous_u').
      The plastic multiplier should also have two versions (typically 'xi'
      and 'Previous_xi') the first one being defined as data if
      <literal>unknowns_type </literal> is 'DISPLACEMENT_ONLY' or the integer value 0, or as
      a variable if <literal>unknowns_type</literal> is DISPLACEMENT_AND_PLASTIC_MULTIPLIER
      or the integer value 1.
      The plastic strain should represent a n x n data tensor field stored
      on mesh_fem or (preferably) on an im_data (corresponding to <literal>mim</literal>).
      The data are the first Lame coefficient, the second one (shear modulus)
      and the uniaxial yield stress. A typical call is
      gf_model_get(model M, 'add small strain elastoplasticity brick', mim, 'Prandtl Reuss', 0, 'u', 'xi', 'Previous_Ep', 'lambda', 'mu', 'sigma_y', '1', 'timestep');
      IMPORTANT: Note that this law implements
      the 3D expressions. If it is used in 2D, the expressions are just
      transposed to the 2D. For the plane strain approximation, see below.
    - "plane strain Prandtl Reuss"
      (or "plane strain isotropic perfect plasticity")
      The same law as the previous one but adapted to the plane strain
      approximation. Can only be used in 2D.
    - "Prandtl Reuss linear hardening"
      (or "isotropic plasticity linear hardening").
      Isotropic elasto-plasticity with linear isotropic and kinematic
      hardening. An additional variable compared to "Prandtl Reuss" law:
      the accumulated plastic strain. Similarly to the plastic strain, it
      is only stored at the end of the time step, so a simple data is
      required (preferably on an im_data).
      Two additional parameters: the kinematic hardening modulus and the
      isotropic one. 3D expressions only. A typical call is
      gf_model_get(model M, 'add small strain elastoplasticity brick', mim, 'Prandtl Reuss linear hardening', 0, 'u', 'xi', 'Previous_Ep', 'Previous_alpha', 'lambda', 'mu', 'sigma_y', 'H_k', H_i', '1', 'timestep');
    - "plane strain Prandtl Reuss linear hardening"
      (or "plane strain isotropic plasticity linear hardening").
      The same law as the previous one but adapted to the plane strain
      approximation. Can only be used in 2D.
    
    See GetFEM user documentation for further explanations on the
    discretization of the plastic flow and on the implemented plastic laws.
    See also GetFEM user documentation on time integration strategy
    (integration of transient problems).
    
    IMPORTANT : remember that <literal>small_strain_elastoplasticity_next_iter</literal> has
    to be called at the end of each time step, before the next one
    (and before any post-treatment : this sets the value of the plastic
    strain and plastic multiplier).

    Add a finite strain elastoplasticity brick to the model.
    For the moment there is only one supported law defined through

    This law supports to possibilities of unknown variables to solve for
    defined by means of <literal>unknowns_type</literal> set to either
    'DISPLACEMENT_AND_PLASTIC_MULTIPLIER' (integer value 1) or

      Cauchy-Green tensor at the previous time step
      (it has to be a 4 element vector for plane strain 2D problems
      and a 6 element vector for 3D problems).
    
    The  "Simo_Miehe" law also expects as <literal>params</literal> a set of the

    - an expression for the initial shear modulus G,
    - the name of a user predefined function that decribes

    value or a vector of the same size as <literal>multname_n</literal>. The optional
    parameters <literal>slave1</literal> and <literal>slave2</literal> declare if the regions defined in <literal>rg1</literal>
    and <literal>rg2</literal> are correspondingly considered as "slaves". By default
    <literal>slave1</literal> is true and <literal>slave2</literal> is false, i.e. <literal>rg1</literal> contains the slave
    surfaces, while 'rg2' the master surfaces. Preferrably only one of
    <literal>slave1</literal> and <literal>slave2</literal> is set to true.  The parameter <literal>augmented_version</literal>
    indicates the augmentation strategy : 1 for the non-symmetric
    Alart-Curnier augmented Lagrangian, 2 for the symmetric one (except for
    the coupling between contact and Coulomb friction),
    3 for the new unsymmetric method.
    Basically, this brick computes the matrices BN and BT and the vectors
    gap and alpha and calls the basic contact brick.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add nonmatching meshes contact brick',  mesh_im mim1[, mesh_im mim2], string varname_u1[, string varname_u2], string multname_n[, string multname_t], string dataname_r[, string dataname_fr], int rg1, int rg2[, int slave1, int slave2,  int augmented_version])``

    DEPRECATED FUNCTION. Use 'add nodal contact between nonmatching meshes brick' instead.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add integral contact between nonmatching meshes brick',  mesh_im mim, string varname_u1, string varname_u2, string multname, string dataname_r [, string dataname_friction_coeff], int region1, int region2 [, int option [, string dataname_alpha [, string dataname_wt1 , string dataname_wt2]]])``

    Add a contact with or without friction condition between nonmatching
    meshes to the model. This brick adds a contact which is defined
    in an integral way. It is the direct approximation of an augmented
    agrangian formulation (see Getfem user documentation) defined at the
    continuous level. The advantage should be a better scalability:
    the number of Newton iterations should be more or less independent
    of the mesh size.
    The condition is applied on the variables <literal>varname_u1</literal> and <literal>varname_u2</literal>
    on the boundaries corresponding to <literal>region1</literal> and <literal>region2</literal>.
    <literal>multname</literal> should be a fem variable representing the contact stress
    for the frictionless case and the contact and friction stress for the
    case with friction. An inf-sup condition between <literal>multname</literal> and
    <literal>varname_u1</literal> and <literal>varname_u2</literal> is required.
    The augmentation parameter <literal>dataname_r</literal> should be chosen in a
    range of acceptable values.
    The optional parameter <literal>dataname_friction_coeff</literal> is the friction
    coefficient which could be constant or defined on a finite element
    method on the same mesh as <literal>varname_u1</literal>.
    Possible values for <literal>option</literal> is 1 for the non-symmetric Alart-Curnier
    augmented Lagrangian method, 2 for the symmetric one, 3 for the
    non-symmetric Alart-Curnier method with an additional augmentation
    and 4 for a new unsymmetric method. The default value is 1.
    In case of contact with friction, <literal>dataname_alpha</literal>, <literal>dataname_wt1</literal> and
    <literal>dataname_wt2</literal> are optional parameters to solve evolutionary friction
    problems.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add penalized contact between nonmatching meshes brick',  mesh_im mim, string varname_u1, string varname_u2, string dataname_r [, string dataname_coeff], int region1, int region2 [, int option [, string dataname_lambda, [, string dataname_alpha [, string dataname_wt1, string dataname_wt2]]]])``

    Add a penalized contact condition with or without friction between
    nonmatching meshes to the model.
    The condition is applied on the variables <literal>varname_u1</literal> and  <literal>varname_u2</literal>
    on the boundaries corresponding to <literal>region1</literal> and <literal>region2</literal>.
    The penalization parameter <literal>dataname_r</literal> should be chosen
    large enough to prescribe approximate non-penetration and friction
    conditions but not too large not to deteriorate too much the
    conditionning of the tangent system.
    The optional parameter <literal>dataname_friction_coeff</literal> is the friction
    coefficient which could be constant or defined on a finite element
    method on the same mesh as <literal>varname_u1</literal>.
    <literal>dataname_lambda</literal> is an optional parameter used if option
    is 2. In that case, the penalization term is shifted by lambda (this
    allows the use of an Uzawa algorithm on the corresponding augmented
    Lagrangian formulation)
    In case of contact with friction, <literal>dataname_alpha</literal>, <literal>dataname_wt1</literal> and
    <literal>dataname_wt2</literal> are optional parameters to solve evolutionary friction
    problems.


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add integral large sliding contact brick raytracing', string dataname_r, scalar release_distance, [, string dataname_fr[, string dataname_alpha[, int version]]])``

    Adds a large sliding contact with friction brick to the model.
    This brick is able to deal with self-contact, contact between
    several deformable bodies and contact with rigid obstacles.
    It uses the high-level generic assembly. It adds to the model
    a raytracing_interpolate_transformation object.
    For each slave boundary a multiplier variable should be defined.
    The release distance should be determined with care
    (generally a few times a mean element size, and less than the
    thickness of the body). Initially, the brick is added with no contact
    boundaries. The contact boundaries and rigid bodies are added with
    special functions. <literal>version</literal> is 0 (the default value) for the
    non-symmetric version and 1 for the more symmetric one
    (not fully symmetric even without friction).


  ``gf_model_set(model M, 'add rigid obstacle to large sliding contact brick', int indbrick, string expr, int N)``

    with friction brick. <literal>expr</literal> is an expression using the high-level
    generic assembly language (where <literal>x</literal> is the current point n the mesh)
    which should be a signed distance to the obstacle.

    Adds a contact boundary to an existing large sliding contact
    with friction brick which is both master and slave
    (allowing the self-contact).


  ``ind = gf_model_set(model M, 'add Nitsche large sliding contact brick raytracing', bool unbiased_version, string dataname_r, scalar release_distance[, string dataname_fr[, string dataname_alpha[, int version]]])``

    Adds a large sliding contact with friction brick to the model based on the Nitsche's method.
    This brick is able to deal with self-contact, contact between
    several deformable bodies and contact with rigid obstacles.
    It uses the high-level generic assembly. It adds to the model
    a raytracing_interpolate_transformation object. "unbiased_version" refers to the version of Nische's method to be used.
    (unbiased or biased one).
    For each slave boundary a  material law should be defined as a function of the dispacement variable on this boundary.
    The release distance should be determined with care
    (generally a few times a mean element size, and less than the
    thickness of the body). Initially, the brick is added with no contact
    boundaries. The contact boundaries and rigid bodies are added with
    special functions. <literal>version</literal> is 0 (the default value) for the
    non-symmetric version and 1 for the more symmetric one
    (not fully symmetric even without friction).

    Adds a rigid obstacle to an existing large sliding contact
    with friction brick. <literal>expr</literal> is an expression using the high-level
    generic assembly language (where <literal>x</literal> is the current point n the mesh)
    which should be a signed distance to the obstacle.
    <literal>N</literal> is the mesh dimension.


  ``gf_model_set(model M, 'add master contact boundary to biased Nitsche large sliding contact brick', int indbrick, mesh_im mim, int region, string dispname[, string wname])``

    Adds a master contact boundary to an existing biased Nitsche's large sliding contact

  sl = gf_slice('streamlines', mesh_fem mf, mat U, mat S)
  sl = gf_slice('points', mesh m, mat Pts)
  sl = gf_slice('load', string filename[, mesh m])

**Description :**


General constructor for slice objects.

  Creation of a mesh slice. Mesh slices are very similar to a
  P1-discontinuous mesh_fem on which interpolation is very fast. The slice is
  built from a mesh object, and a description of the slicing operation, for
  example::

    sl = gf_slice({'planar',+1,[0;0],[1;0]}, m, 5);

  cuts the original mesh with the half space {y>0}. Each convex of the
  original mesh <literal>m</literal> is simplexified (for example a quadrangle is splitted
  into 2 triangles), and each simplex is refined 5 times.

  Slicing operations can be:

  * cutting with a plane, a sphere or a cylinder
  * intersection or union of slices
  * isovalues surfaces/volumes
  * "points", "streamlines" (see below)

  If the first argument is a mesh_fem <literal>mf</literal> instead of a mesh, and if it is
  followed by a <literal>mf</literal>-field <literal>u</literal>, then the deformation <literal>u</literal> will be applied to the
  mesh before the slicing operation.

  The first argument can also be a slice.


**Command list :**



  ``sl = gf_slice(sliceop, {slice sl|{mesh m| mesh_fem mf, vec U}, int refine}[, mat CVfids])``

    Create a slice using <literal>sliceop</literal> operation.
    
    <literal>sliceop</literal> operation is specified with Scilab CELL arrays (i.e. with braces) . The first element is the
    name of the operation, followed the slicing options:
    
    * {'none'} :
      Does not cut the mesh.
    
    * {'planar', int orient, vec p, vec n} :
      Planar cut. <literal>p</literal> and <literal>n</literal> define a half-space, <literal>p</literal> being a point belong to
      the boundary of the half-space, and <literal>n</literal> being its normal. If <literal>orient</literal> is
      equal to -1 (resp. 0, +1), then the slicing operation will cut the mesh
      with the "interior" (resp. "boundary", "exterior") of the half-space.
      <literal>orient</literal> may also be set to +2 which means that the mesh will be sliced,
      but both the outer and inner parts will be kept.
    
    * {'ball', int orient, vec c, scalar r} :
      Cut with a ball of center <literal>c</literal> and radius <literal>r</literal>.
    
    * {'cylinder', int orient, vec p1, vec p2, scalar r} :
      Cut with a cylinder whose axis is the line <literal>(p1, p2)</literal> and whose radius
      is <literal>r</literal>.
    
    * {'isovalues', int orient, mesh_fem mf, vec U, scalar s} :
      Cut using the isosurface of the field <literal>U</literal> (defined on the mesh_fem <literal>mf</literal>).
      The result is the set <literal>{x such that <latex style="text"><![CDATA[U(x) \leq s]]></latex>}</literal> or <literal>{x such that
      </literal>U<literal>(x)=</literal>s<literal>}</literal> or <literal>{x such that </literal>U<literal>(x) >= </literal>s<literal>}</literal> depending on the value of
      <literal>orient</literal>.
    
    * {'boundary'[, SLICEOP]} :
      Return the boundary of the result of SLICEOP, where SLICEOP is any
      slicing operation. If SLICEOP is not specified, then the whole mesh is
      considered (i.e. it is equivalent to {'boundary',{'none'}}).
    
    * {'explode', mat Coef} :
      Build an 'exploded' view of the mesh: each convex is shrinked (<latex style="text"><![CDATA[0 <
      \text{Coef} \leq 1]]></latex>). In the case of 3D convexes, only their faces are kept.
    
    * {'union', SLICEOP1, SLICEOP2} :
      Returns the union of slicing operations.
    
    * {'intersection', SLICEOP1, SLICEOP2} :
      Returns the intersection of slicing operations, for example::
    
        sl = gf_slice({intersection',{'planar',+1,[0;0;0],[0;0;1]},
                                   {'isovalues',-1,mf2,u2,0}},mf,u,5)
    
    * {'comp', SLICEOP} :
      Returns the complementary of slicing operations.
    
    * {'diff', SLICEOP1, SLICEOP2} :
      Returns the difference of slicing operations.
    
    * {'mesh', mesh m} :
      Build a slice which is the intersection of the sliced mesh with another
      mesh. The slice is such that all of its simplexes are stricly contained
      into a convex of each mesh.
    


  ``sl = gf_slice('streamlines', mesh_fem mf, mat U, mat S)``

    Compute streamlines of the (vector) field <literal>U</literal>, with seed points given
    by the columns of <literal>S</literal>.


  ``sl = gf_slice('points', mesh m, mat Pts)``

    Return the "slice" composed of points given by the columns of <literal>Pts</literal>
    (useful for interpolation on a given set of sparse points, see
    <literal></literal>gf_compute('interpolate on',sl)<literal></literal>).


  ``sl = gf_slice('load', string filename[, mesh m])``

    Load the slice (and its linked mesh if it is not given as an argument)
    from a text file.

  s = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'char')
  gf_slice_get(slice S, 'display')

**Description :**


  General function for querying information about slice objects.


**Command list :**



  ``d = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'dim')``

    Return the dimension of the slice (2 for a 2D mesh, etc..).


  ``a = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'area')``

    Return the area of the slice.


  ``CVids = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'cvs')``

    Return the list of convexes of the original mesh contained in the slice.


  ``n = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'nbpts')``

    Return the number of points in the slice.


  ``ns = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'nbsplxs'[, int dim])``

    Return the number of simplexes in the slice.
    
    Since the slice may contain points (simplexes of dim 0), segments
    (simplexes of dimension 1), triangles etc., the result is a vector
    of size gf_slice_get(slice S, 'dim')+1, except if the optional argument <literal>dim</literal>
    is used.


  ``P = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'pts')``

    Return the list of point coordinates.


  ``{S, CV2S} = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'splxs',int dim)``

    Return the list of simplexes of dimension <literal>dim</literal>.
    
    On output, S has 'dim+1' rows, each column contains the point
    numbers of a simplex.  The vector <literal>CV2S</literal> can be used to find the
    list of simplexes for any convex stored in the slice. For example
    'S(:,CV2S(4):CV2S(5)-1)'
    gives the list of simplexes for the fourth convex.


  ``{P, E1, E2} = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'edges')``

    Return the edges of the linked mesh contained in the slice.
    
    <literal>P</literal> contains the list of all edge vertices, <literal>E1</literal> contains
    the indices of each mesh edge in <literal>P</literal>, and <literal>E2</literal> contains the
    indices of each "edges" which is on the border of the slice.
    This function is useless except for post-processing purposes.


  ``Usl = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'interpolate_convex_data', mat Ucv)``

    Interpolate data given on each convex of the mesh to the slice nodes.
    
    The input array <literal>Ucv</literal> may have any number of dimensions, but its
    last dimension should be equal to gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'max cvid').
    
    Example of use: gf_slice_get(slice S, 'interpolate_convex_data', gf_mesh_get(mesh M, 'quality')).


  ``m = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'linked mesh')``

    Return the mesh on which the slice was taken.


  ``m = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'mesh')``

    Return the mesh on which the slice was taken
    (identical to 'linked mesh')


  ``z = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'memsize')``

    Return the amount of memory (in bytes) used by the slice object.


  ``gf_slice_get(slice S, 'export to vtk', string filename, ...)``

    Export a slice to VTK.
    
    Following the <literal>filename</literal>, you may use any of the following options:
    
    - if 'ascii' is not used, the file will contain binary data
      (non portable, but fast).
    - if 'edges' is used, the edges of the original mesh will be
      written instead of the slice content.
    
    More than one dataset may be written, just list them. Each dataset
    consists of either:
    
    - a field interpolated on the slice (scalar, vector or tensor),
      followed by an optional name.
    - a mesh_fem and a field, followed by an optional name.
    
    Examples:

    Following the <literal>filename</literal>, you may use any of the following
    options:
    
    - if 'ascii' is not used, the file will contain binary data
      (non portable, but fast).
    - if 'edges' is used, the edges of the original mesh will be
      written instead of the slice content.
    - if 'append' is used, the opendx file will not be overwritten,
      and the new data will be added at the end of the file.
    
    More than one dataset may be written, just list them. Each dataset
    consists of either:
    
    - a field interpolated on the slice (scalar, vector or tensor),
      followed by an optional name.
    - a mesh_fem and a field, followed by an optional name.

    - a mesh_fem and a field.


  ``s = gf_slice_get(slice S, 'char')``

    Output a (unique) string representation of the slice.
    
    This can be used to perform comparisons between two
    different slice objects.
    This function is to be completed.


  ``gf_slice_get(slice S, 'display')``

    displays a short summary for a slice object.

    you can use the function to apply a deformation to a slice, or to
    change the dimension of the slice (the number of rows of <literal>P</literal> is not
    required to be equal to gf_slice_get(slice S, 'dim')).

  SM = gf_spmat('diag', mat D [, ivec E [, int n [,int m]]])
  SM = gf_spmat('load','hb'|'harwell-boeing'|'mm'|'matrix-market', string filename)

**Description :**


General constructor for spmat objects.

  Create a new sparse matrix in GetFEM format. These sparse matrix can be stored as CSC (compressed column
  sparse), which is the format used by Matlab, or they can be stored as WSC
  (internal format to getfem). The CSC matrices are not writable (it would
  be very inefficient), but they are optimized for multiplication with
  vectors, and memory usage. The WSC are writable, they are very fast with
  respect to random read/write operation. However their memory overhead is
  higher than CSC matrices, and they are a little bit slower for
  matrix-vector multiplications.

  By default, all newly created matrices are build as WSC matrices. This can
  be changed later with <literal></literal>gf_spmat_set(spmat S, 'to_csc',...)<literal></literal>, or may be changed
  automatically by getfem (for example <literal></literal>gf_linsolve()<literal></literal> converts the
  matrices to CSC).

  The matrices may store REAL or COMPLEX values.


**Command list :**



  ``SM = gf_spmat('empty', int m [, int n])``

    Create a new empty (i.e. full of zeros) sparse matrix, of dimensions
    <literal>m x n</literal>. If <literal>n</literal> is omitted, the matrix dimension is <literal>m x m</literal>.


  ``SM = gf_spmat('copy', mat K [,  I [,  J=I]])``

    Duplicate a matrix <literal>K</literal> (which might be an spmat). If index <literal>I</literal> and/or <literal>J</literal> are given, the matrix will
    be a submatrix of <literal>K</literal>. For example::
    
      
      m = gf_spmat('copy', sprand(50,50,.1), 1:40, [6 7 8 3 10])
      
    
    will return a 40x5 matrix.


  ``SM = gf_spmat('identity', int n)``

    Create a <literal>n x n</literal> identity matrix.


  ``SM = gf_spmat('mult', spmat A, spmat B)``

    Create a sparse matrix as the product of the sparse matrices <literal>A</literal> and
    <literal>B</literal>. It requires that <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal> be both real or both complex, you
    may have to use <literal></literal>gf_spmat_set(spmat S, 'to_complex')<literal></literal>.


  ``SM = gf_spmat('add', spmat A, spmat B)``

    Create a sparse matrix as the sum of the sparse matrices <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal>.
    Adding a real matrix with a complex matrix is possible.


  ``SM = gf_spmat('diag', mat D [, ivec E [, int n [,int m]]])``

    Create a diagonal matrix. If <literal>E</literal> is given, <literal>D</literal> might be a matrix and
    each column of <literal>E</literal> will contain the sub-diagonal number that will be
    filled with the corresponding column of <literal>D</literal>.


  ``SM = gf_spmat('load','hb'|'harwell-boeing'|'mm'|'matrix-market', string filename)``

    Read a sparse matrix from an Harwell-Boeing or a Matrix-Market file
    .

  gf_workspace('clear')
  gf_workspace('clear all')
  gf_workspace('class name', i)

**Description :**


    GetFEM workspace management function.

    GetFEM uses its own workspaces in Matlab, independently of the
    matlab workspaces (this is due to some limitations in the memory
    management of matlab objects). By default, all getfem variables
    belong to the root getfem workspace. A function can create its own
    workspace by invoking gf_workspace('push') at its beginning. When
    exiting, this function MUST invoke gf_workspace('pop') (you can
    use matlab exceptions handling to do this cleanly when the
    function exits on an error).
 

**Command list :**



  ``gf_workspace('push')``

    Create a new temporary workspace on the workspace stack.


  ``gf_workspace('pop',  [,i,j, ...])``

    Leave the current workspace, destroying all getfem objects
    belonging to it, except the one listed after 'pop', and the ones
    moved to parent workspace by gf_workspace('keep').


  ``gf_workspace('stat')``

    Print informations about variables in current workspace.


  ``gf_workspace('stats')``

    Print informations about all getfem variables.


  ``gf_workspace('keep', i[,j,k...])``

    prevent the listed variables from being deleted when
    gf_workspace("pop") will be called by moving these variables in the
    parent workspace.


  ``gf_workspace('keep all')``

    prevent all variables from being deleted when
    gf_workspace("pop") will be called by moving the variables in the
    parent workspace.


  ``gf_workspace('clear')``

    Clear the current workspace.


  ``gf_workspace('clear all')``

    Clear every workspace, and returns to the main workspace (you
    should not need this command).


  ``gf_workspace('class name', i)``

    Return the class name of object i (if I is a mesh handle, it
    return gfMesh etc..)
