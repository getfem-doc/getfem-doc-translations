Installation
============

The installation of the |sci| |gf| toolbox can be somewhat tricky, since it combines a C++ compiler, libraries and |sci| interaction. In case of troubles with a
non-GNU compiler, gcc/g++ (>= 4.8) should be a safe solution. The minimal |sci| release is the 5.2.2.



See the `download and install <../download.html>`_ page for the installation of |gf| on different plateforms.
