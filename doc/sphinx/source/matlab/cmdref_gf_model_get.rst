    term inside the brick (default value : 1).
    `sym` is to access to the second right hand side of for symmetric
    terms acting on two different variables (default is 0).
    `ind_iter` is the iteration number when time dispatchers are
    used (default is 1).
    


  ``z = gf_model_get(model M, 'memsize')``

    Return a rough approximation of the amount of memory (in bytes) used by
    the model.

    Interpolate a certain expression with respect to the mesh_fem `mf`
    or the mesh_im_data `mimd` or the set of points `pts` on mesh `m`.
    The expression has to be valid according to the high-level generic
    assembly language possibly including references to the variables
    and data of the model.
    
    The options `extrapolation` and `rg_source` are specific to
    interpolations with respect to a set of points `pts`. 


  ``V = gf_model_get(model M, 'local_projection', mesh_im mim, string expr, mesh_fem mf[, int region])``

    Make an elementwise L2 projection of an expression with respect
    to the mesh_fem `mf`. This mesh_fem has to be

    of the concatenation of the variables of the model (useful
    to solve your problem with you own solver). 


  ``gf_model_get(model M, 'assembly'[, string option])``

    Assembly of the tangent system taking into account the terms
    from all bricks. `option`, if specified, should be 'build_all',
    'build_rhs', 'build_matrix'.
    The default is to build the whole
    tangent linear system (matrix and rhs). This function is useful
    to solve your problem with you own solver. 


  ``{nbit, converged} = gf_model_get(model M, 'solve'[, ...])``

    Run the standard getfem solver.
    
    Note that you should be able to use your own solver if you want
    (it is possible to obtain the tangent matrix and its right hand
    side with the gf_model_get(model M, 'tangent matrix') etc.).
    
    Various options can be specified:
    
    - 'noisy' or 'very_noisy'
       the solver will display some information showing the progress
       (residual values etc.).
    - 'max_iter', int NIT
       set the maximum iterations numbers.
    - 'max_res', @float RES
       set the target residual value.
    - 'diverged_res', @float RES
       set the threshold value of the residual beyond which the iterative
       method is considered to diverge (default is 1e200).
    - 'lsolver', string SOLVER_NAME
       select explicitely the solver used for the linear systems (the
       default value is 'auto', which lets getfem choose itself).
       Possible values are 'superlu', 'mumps' (if supported),
       'cg/ildlt', 'gmres/ilu' and 'gmres/ilut'.
    - 'lsearch', string LINE_SEARCH_NAME
       select explicitely the line search method used for the linear systems (the
       default value is 'default').
       Possible values are 'simplest', 'systematic', 'quadratic' or 'basic'.
    
      Return the number of iterations, if an iterative method is used.
      
      Note that it is possible to disable some variables
      (see gf_model_set(model M, 'disable variable') ) in order to
      solve the problem only with respect to a subset of variables (the
      disabled variables are then considered as data) for instance to
      replace the global Newton strategy with a fixed point one.
    
      


  ``gf_model_get(model M, 'test tangent matrix'[, scalar EPS[, int NB[, scalar scale]]])``

    Test the consistency of the tangent matrix in some random positions
    and random directions (useful to test newly created bricks).
    `EPS` is the value of the small parameter for the finite difference
    computation of the derivative is the random direction (default is 1E-6).
    `NN` is the number of tests (default is 100). `scale` is a parameter
    for the random position (default is 1, 0 is an acceptable value) around
    the current position.
    Each dof of the random position is chosen in the range
    [current-scale, current+scale].
    


  ``gf_model_get(model M, 'test tangent matrix term', string varname1, string varname2[, scalar EPS[, int NB[, scalar scale]]])``

    Test the consistency of a part of the tangent matrix in some
    random positions and random directions
    (useful to test newly created bricks).
    The increment is only made on variable `varname2` and tested on the
    part of the residual corresponding to `varname1`. This means that
    only the term (`varname1`, `varname2`) of the tangent matrix is tested.
    `EPS` is the value of the small parameter for the finite difference
    computation of the derivative is the random direction (default is 1E-6).
    `NN` is the number of tests (default is 100). `scale` is a parameter
    for the random position (default is 1, 0 is an acceptable value)
    around the current position.
    Each dof of the random position is chosen in the range
    [current-scale, current+scale].
    


  ``expr = gf_model_get(model M, 'Neumann term', string varname, int region)``

    Gives the assembly string corresponding to the Neumann term of
    the fem variable `varname` on `region`. It is deduced from the
    assembly string declared by the model bricks.
    `region` should be the index of a boundary region
    on the mesh where `varname` is defined. Care to call this function
    only after all the volumic bricks have been declared.
    Complains, if a brick
    omit to declare an assembly string.

    valid for isotropic linearized elasticity in 3D). `version` should
    be  'Von_Mises' or 'Tresca' ('Von_Mises' is the default).
    Parametrized by Lame coefficients.

    for nonlinear elasticity in 3D. `lawname` is the constitutive law which
    could be 'SaintVenant Kirchhoff', 'Mooney Rivlin', 'neo Hookean' or
    'Ciarlet Geymonat'.
    `dataname` is a vector of parameters for the constitutive law. Its length
    depends on the law. It could be a short vector of constant values or a
    vector field described on a finite element method for variable coefficients.
    `version` should be  'Von_Mises' or 'Tresca' ('Von_Mises' is the default).

    iteration to the next one.
    Compute and save the stress constraints sigma for the next iterations.
    'mim' is the integration method to use for the computation.
    'varname' is the main variable of the problem.

  ``gf_model_get(model M, 'small strain elastoplasticity next iter', mesh_im mim,  string lawname, string unknowns_type [, string varnames, ...] [, string params, ...] [, string theta = '1' [, string dt = 'timestep']] [, int region = -1])``

    Function that allows to pass from a time step to another for the
    small strain plastic brick. The parameters have to be exactly the
    same than the one of `add_small_strain_elastoplasticity_brick`,
    so see the documentation of this function for the explanations.
    Basically, this brick computes the plastic strain
    and the plastic multiplier and stores them for the next step.
    Additionaly, it copies the computed displacement to the data
    that stores the displacement of the previous time step (typically
    'u' to 'Previous_u'). It has to be called before any use of
    `compute_small_strain_elastoplasticity_Von_Mises`.
    


  ``V = gf_model_get(model M, 'small strain elastoplasticity Von Mises', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_vm, string lawname, string unknowns_type [, string varnames, ...] [, string params, ...] [, string theta = '1' [, string dt = 'timestep']] [, int region])``

    This function computes the Von Mises stress field with respect to
    a small strain elastoplasticity term, approximated on `mf_vm`,
    and stores the result into `VM`.  All other parameters have to be
    exactly the same as for `add_small_strain_elastoplasticity_brick`.
    Remember that `small_strain_elastoplasticity_next_iter` has to be called
    before any call of this function.

    `datasigma` is a vector which contains the stress constraints values supported by the mesh.
    `version` should be  'Von_Mises' or 'Tresca' ('Von_Mises' is the default).


  ``V = gf_model_get(model M, 'compute plastic part', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_pl, string varname, string previous_dep_name, string projname, string datalambda, string datamu, string datathreshold, string datasigma)``

    Compute on `mf_pl` the plastic part and return it into the vector V.
    `datasigma` is a vector which contains the stress constraints values supported by the mesh.

    Function that allows to pass from a time step to another for the
    finite strain plastic brick. The parameters have to be exactly the
    same than the one of `add_finite_strain_elastoplasticity_brick`,
    so see the documentation of this function for the explanations.
    Basically, this brick computes the plastic strain
    and the plastic multiplier and stores them for the next step.
    For the Simo-Miehe law which is currently the only one implemented,
    this function updates the state variables defined in the last two
    entries of `varnames`, and resets the plastic multiplier field given
    as the second entry of `varnames`.
    


  ``V = gf_model_get(model M, 'compute finite strain elastoplasticity Von Mises', mesh_im mim, mesh_fem mf_vm, string lawname, string unknowns_type, [, string varnames, ...] [, string params, ...] [, int region = -1])``

    Compute on `mf_vm` the Von-Mises or the Tresca stress of a field for plasticity and return it into the vector V.
