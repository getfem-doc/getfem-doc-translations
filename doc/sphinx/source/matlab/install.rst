Installation
============

The installation of the |gfi| toolbox can be somewhat tricky, since it combines a
C++ compiler, libraries and |Mlab| interaction... In case of troubles with a
non-GNU compiler, gcc/g++ (>= 4.8) should be a safe solution.

See the `download and install <../download.html>`_ page for the installation of |gf| on different plateforms.
