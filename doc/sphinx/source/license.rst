History and License
*******************

GetFEM was born during the PhD thesis of Yves Renard (1994-1998, the first files dating from 1995). The fundamental bases of GetFEM (assembly in any dimension, separation of geometric transformations, finite element methods and cubature methods) date from 1999. However, GetFEM did not take the size it is now without the contributions of Julien Pommier since 2001. His major contributions are generic assembly, Matlab and Python interfaces and the graphical postprocessing (including nice Matlab functions, vtk, open DX output, slices ...). Early versions distributed in 2002 already contain these components. Since then, GetFEM grows thanks to various collaborations and external contributions.
