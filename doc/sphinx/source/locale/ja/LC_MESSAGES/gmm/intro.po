"|gmm| provides some basic types of sparse and dense matrices and vectors. It"
" provides some generic operations on them (copy, addition, multiplication, "
"sub-vector and sub-matrices, solvers ... ). The syntax of |gmm| is very "
"close to MTL and ITL (see http://www.osl.iu.edu/research/mtl/). Especially, "
"the code for most of the iterative solvers has been imported from ITL. The "
"performance of |gmm| is also close to the one of MTL, sometimes better. The "
"difference is that basically |gmm| has been written to be able to interface "
"other libraries and gives an access to sub matrices and sub vectors in all "
"cases. Also some optimizations has been made for matrix-matrix "
"multiplication, usage of reference has been somewhat cleared, const "
"qualifier usage is clarified, and we hope it is somewhat easier to use."

"|gmm| "
"はいくつかの基本的な型の疎行列と密行列およびベクトルを提供します。それらに対するいくつかの一般的な操作（コピー、加算、乗算、部分ベクトルとサブ行列、ソルバー...）を提供します。"
" |gmm| の構文はMTLおよびITL（http://www.osl.iu.edu/research/mtl/ "
"を参照）に非常に近いです。特に、ほとんどの反復ソルバーのコードはITLから持ち込まれています。 また、 |gmm| "
"のパフォーマンスはMTLに近い場合があり、時にはそれを上回ります。違いは、基本的に |gmm| "
"は他のライブラリと互換できるように記述されており、すべての場合において部分行列と部分ベクトルにアクセスできることです。また、行列と行列の乗算の最適化がいくつか行われ、参照の使用法がいくらか明確になり、const修飾子の使用法が明確になりました。"
