"The GetFEM library has a substantial body of documentation, much of it "
"contributed by various authors. The markup used for the GetFEM documentation"
" is `reStructuredText`_, developed by the `docutils`_ project, amended by "
"custom directives and using a toolset named `Sphinx`_ to postprocess the "
"HTML output."

"If you're interested in contributing to GetFEM's documentation, there's no "
"need to write reStructuredText if you're not so inclined; plain text "
"contributions are more than welcome as well. The main documentations are in "
"the directory ``doc/sphinx/source`` of the project. A part of the "
"documentation is automatic and comes from the sources of the project. This "
"is in particular the case for the documentations of the interface commands "
"which are located in the ``interface/src/gf_*.cc`` files."
