"where :math:`a` is the coefficient and :math:`u` the variable. The "
"coefficient can be a scalar, a matrix or an order four tensor. The variable "
"can be vector valued or not. This means that the brick treats several "
"different situations. If the coefficient is a scalar or a matrix and the "
"variable is vector valued then the term is added componentwise. An order "
"four tensor coefficient is allowed for vector valued variable only.  The "
"coefficient can be constant or described on a FEM. Of course, when the "
"coefficient is a tensor described on a finite element method (a tensor "
"field) the corresponding data can be a huge vector. The components of the "
"matrix/tensor have to be stored with the fortran order (columnwise) in the "
"data vector corresponding to the coefficient (compatibility with BLAS). The "
"symmetry and coercivity of the given matrix/tensor is not verified (but "
"assumed)."

"that adds an elliptic term relatively to the variable ``varname`` of the "
"model with a constant coefficient equal to :math:`1` (a Laplacian term). "
"This corresponds to the Laplace operator. ``mim`` is the integration method "
"which will be used to compute the term. ``region`` is an optional region "
"number. If it is omitted, it is assumed that the term will be computed on "
"the whole mesh. The result of the function is the brick index in the model."
