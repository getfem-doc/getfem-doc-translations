"where ``md``is the model object, ``mim`` is the integration method, "
"``varname`` is the variable of the model for which the source term is added,"
" ``dataexpr`` has to be  a regular expression of GWFL, the generic weak form"
" language (except for the complex version where it has to be a declared data"
" of the model). It has to be scalar or vector valued depending on the fact "
"that the variable is scalar or vector valued itself. ``region`` is a mesh "
"region on which the term is added. If the region corresponds to a boundary, "
"the source term will represent a Neumann condition. ``directdataname`` is an"
" optional additional data which will directly be added to the right hand "
"side without assembly."

"The difference compared to the basic source term brick is that the data "

"performed on it."
