"|gf| provides a generic implementation of Nitche's method which allows to "
"account for Dirichlet type or contact with friction boundary conditions in a"
" weak sense without the use of Lagrange multipliers. The method is very "
"attractive because it transforms a Dirichlet boundary condition into a weak "
"term similar to a Neumann boundary condition. However, this advantage is at "
"the cost that the implementation of Nitche's method is model dependent, "
"since it requires an approximation of the corresponding Neumann term. In "
"order to add a boundary condition with Nitsche's method on a variable of a "
"model, the corresponding brick needs to have access to an approximation of "
"the Neumann term of all partial differential terms applied to this variable."

"the sum of all Neumann terms on this variable. Note that the Neumann term "
":math:`G` will often depend on the variable :math:`u` but it may also depend"
" on other variables of the model. This is the case for instance for mixed "
"formulations of incompressible elasticity. The Neumann terms depend also "
"frequently on some parameters of the model (elasticity coefficients ...) but"
" this is assumed to be contained in its expression."

"For instance, if there is a Laplace term (:math:`\\Delta u`), applied on the"
" variable :math:`u`, the Neumann term will be :math:`G = \\dfrac{\\partial "
"u}{\\partial n}` where :math:`n` is the outward unit normal on the "
"considered boundary. If :math:`u` represents the displacements of a "
"deformable body, the Neumann term will be :math:`G = \\sigma(u)n`, where "
":math:`\\sigma(u)` is the stress tensor depending on the constitutive law. "
"Of course, in that case :math:`G` also depends on some material parameters. "
"If additionally a mixed incompressibility brick is added with a variable "
":math:`p` denoting the pressure, the Neumann term on :math:`u` will depend "
"on :math:`p` in the following way: :math:`G = \\sigma(u)n - pn`"
