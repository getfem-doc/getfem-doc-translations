"where ``mf`` is a variable of type |gf_mf|, ``U`` is a vector which "
"represent the field to be convected, ``mf_v`` is a |gf_mf| for the velocity "
"field, ``V`` is the dof vector for the velocity field, ``dt`` is the pseudo "
"time of convection and ``nt`` the number of iterations for the computation "
"of characteristics. ``option`` is an option for the boundary condition where"
" there is a re-entrant convection. The possibilities are "
"getfem::CONVECT_EXTRAPOLATION (extrapolation of the field on the nearest "
"element) or getfem::CONVECT_UNCHANGED (no change of the value on the "
"boundary)."
