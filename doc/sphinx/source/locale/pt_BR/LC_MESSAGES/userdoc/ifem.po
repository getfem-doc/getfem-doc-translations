"Basically, It is sufficient to describe an element on the reference element,"
" i.e. to describe each base function of each degree of freedom. "
"Intrinsically vectorial elements are supported (see for instance Nedelec and"
" Raviart-Thomas elements). Finite element methods that are not equivalent "
"via the geometric transformation (not :math:`\\tau`-equivalent in |gf| "
"jargon, such as vectorial elements, Hermite elements ...) an additional "
"linear transformation of the degrees of freedom depending on the real "
"element should be described (see the implementation of Argyris element for "
"instance)."
