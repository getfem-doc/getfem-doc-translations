"The following example is a part of the test program "
":file:`tests/laplacian_with_bricks.cc`. Construction of the mesh and finite "
"element methods are omitted. It is assumed that a mesh is build and two "
"finite element methods ``mf_u`` and ``mf_rhs`` are build on this mesh. Is is"
" also assumed that ``NEUMANN_BOUNDARY_NUM`` and ``DIRICHLET_BOUNDARY_NUM`` "
"are two valid boundary indices on that mesh. The code begins by the "
"definition of three functions which are interpolated on ``mf_rhs`` in order "
"to build the data for the source term, the Neumann condition and the "
"Dirichlet condition. Follows the declaration of the model object, the "
"addition of the bricks and the solving of the problem::"
