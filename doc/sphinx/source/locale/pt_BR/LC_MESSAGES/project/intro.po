"The aim of this document is to report details of the internal of |gf| useful"
" for developers that have no place in the user documentation. It is also to "
"outline the main prospects for the future development of |gf|. A list of "
"modifications to be done and main tasks is updated on Savannah |linktask|_."

"The |gf| project focuses on the development of an open source generic finite"
" element library. The goal is to provide a finite element framework which "
"allows to easily build numerical code for the modelisation of system "
"described by partial differential equations (p.d.e.). A special attention is"
" paid to the flexibility of the use of the library in the sense that the "
"switch from a method offered by the library to another is made as easy as "
"possible."

"The major point allowing this, compared to traditional finite element codes,"
" is the complete separation between the description of p.d.e. models and "
"finite element methods. Moreover, a separation is made between integration "
"methods (exact or approximated), geometric transformations (linear or not) "
"and finite element methods of arbitrary degrees described on a reference "
"element. |gf| can be used to build very general finite elements codes, where"
" the finite elements, integration methods, dimension of the meshes, are just"
" some parameters that can be changed very easily, thus allowing a large "
"spectrum of experimentations. Numerous examples are available in the "
":file:`tests` directory of the distribution."

"The goal is also to make the addition of new finite element method as simple"
" as possible. For standard method, a description of the finite element shape"
" functions and the type of connection of degrees of freedom on the reference"
" element is sufficient. Extensions are provided for Hermite elements, "
"piecewise polynomial, non-polynomial, vectorial elements and XFem. Examples "
"of predefined available methods are :math:`P_k` on simplices in arbitrary "
"degrees and dimensions, :math:`Q_k` on parallelepipeds, :math:`P_1`, "
":math:`P_2` with bubble functions, Hermite elements, elements with "
"hierarchic basis (for multigrid methods for instance), discontinuous "
":math:`P_k` or :math:`Q_k`, XFem, Argyris, HCT, Raviart-Thomas."

"The library also includes the usual tools for finite elements such as "
"assembly procedures for classical PDEs, interpolation methods, computation "
"of norms, mesh operations, boundary conditions, post-processing tools such "
"as extraction of slices from a mesh ..."

"The aim of the |gf| project is not to provide a ready to use finite element "
"code allowing for instance structural mechanics computations with a graphic "
"interface. It is basically a library allowing the build of C++  finite "
"element codes. However, the Python, Scilab and matlab interfaces allows to "
"easily build application coupling the definition of the problem, the finite "
"element methods selection and the graphical post-processing."
