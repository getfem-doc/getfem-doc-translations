"A cubature method on an **element** consists in a set of nodes (generally "
"called gauss points) and corresponding loads which define a approximated "
"integration method. In |Gf| it is defined on the **reference elements**."

"The degrees of freedom for a finite element method is the coefficients which"
" multiply the shape functions in order to describe a (scalar or vector) "

"An element is a small piece of a domain with a special shape (a segment, a "
"triangle, a quadrilateron, an tetrahedron, a hexahedron or a prism) for "
"dimensions less or equal to three. A mesh is the union of non intersecting "
"elements."
