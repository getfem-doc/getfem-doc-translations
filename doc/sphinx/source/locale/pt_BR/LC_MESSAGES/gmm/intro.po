"|gmm| provides some basic types of sparse and dense matrices and vectors. It"
" provides some generic operations on them (copy, addition, multiplication, "
"sub-vector and sub-matrices, solvers ... ). The syntax of |gmm| is very "
"close to MTL and ITL (see http://www.mtl4.org/). Especially, the code for "
"most of the iterative solvers has been imported from ITL. The performance of"
" |gmm| is also close to the one of MTL, sometimes better. The difference is "
"that basically |gmm| has been written to be able to interface other "
"libraries and gives an access to sub matrices and sub vectors in all cases. "
"Also some optimizations has been made for matrix-matrix multiplication, "
"usage of reference has been somewhat cleared, const qualifier usage is "
"clarified, and we hope it is somewhat easier to use."
