"Introduction of the `model brick` system, which provides a general framework"
" for the solution of common PDEs. Each brick is dedicated to a specific task"
" (i.e. \"handle Dirichlet conditions\", \"assembly of the Stokes Problem\", "
"\"solve a linear system\", etc.). These bricks are then connected to each "
"other. Examples of use can be found in the \"tests/\" directory of GetFEM."

"getfem-matlab has been renamed \"getfem-interface\" since it now provides an"
" interface for Matlab and `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ (with the "
"`Numarray <http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray>`_ "
"package). Note that, while it is `documented "
"<http://getfem.org/python/index.html>`_ and working, the python interface is"
" still considered a *work in progress*. You have to enable it explicitly "
"with ``./configure --enable-python``. An interface to the Gmm++ sparse "
"matrices and solvers is also provided."
