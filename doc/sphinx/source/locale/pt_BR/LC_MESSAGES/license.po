"GetFEM was born during the PhD thesis of Yves Renard (1994-1998, the first "
"files dating from 1995). The fundamental bases of GetFEM (assembly in any "
"dimension, separation of geometric transformations, finite element methods "
"and cubature methods) date from 1999. However, GetFEM did not take the size "
"it is now without the contributions of Julien Pommier since 2001. His major "
"contributions are generic assembly, Matlab and Python interfaces and the "
"graphical postprocessing (including nice Matlab functions, vtk, open DX "
"output, slices ...). Early versions distributed in 2002 already contain "
"these components. Since then, GetFEM grows thanks to various collaborations "
"and external contributions."
