Iterative solvers
===================================================



Most of the solvers provided in |gmm| come form ITL with slight modifications (gmres has been optimized and adapted for complex matrices). Include the file ``gmm/gmm_iter_solvers.h`` to use them.

iterations
----------

  The iteration object of |gmm| is a modification of the one in ITL. This is not a template type as in ITL.

The simplest initialization is::

  gmm::iteration iter(2.0E-10);

where ``2.0E-10`` is the (relative) residual to be obtained to have the convergence.
Some possibilities::

  iter.set_noisy(n) // n = 0 : no output
                    // n = 1 : output of iterations on the standard output
                    // n = 2 : output of iterations and sub-iterations
                    //         on the standard output
                    // ...
  iter.get_iteration() // after a computation, gives the number of
                       // iterations made.
  iter.converged()     // true if the method converged.
  iter.set_maxiter(n)  // Set the maximum of iterations.
                       // A solver stops if the maximum of iteration is
                       // reached, iter.converged() is then false.


Linear solvers
--------------

Here is the list of available linear solvers::

  gmm::row_matrix< std::vector<double> > A(10, 10);  // The matrix
  std::vector<double> B(10); // Right hand side
  std::vector<double> X(10); // Unknown
  gmm::identity_matrix PS;   // Optional scalar product for cg
  gmm::identity_matrix PR;   // Optional preconditioner
  ...
  gmm::iteration iter(10E-9);// Iteration object with the max residu
  size_t restart = 50;       // restart parameter for GMRES

  gmm::cg(A, X, B, PS, PR, iter); // Conjugate gradient

  gmm::bicgstab(A, X, B, PR, iter); // BICGSTAB BiConjugate Gradient Stabilized

  gmm::gmres(A, X, B, PR, restart, iter) // GMRES generalized minimum residual

  gmm::qmr(A, X, B, PR, iter) // Quasi-Minimal Residual method.

  gmm::least_squares_cg(A, X, B, iter) // unpreconditionned least square CG.


The solver ``gmm::constrained_cg(A, C, X, B, PS, PR, iter);`` solve a system with linear constaints, ``C`` is a matrix which represents the constraints. But it is still experimental.

(Version 1.7) The solver ``gmm::bfgs(F, GRAD, X, restart, iter)`` is a BFGS quasi-Newton algorithm with a Wolfe line search for large scale problems. It minimizes the function ``F`` without constraints, be given its gradient ``GRAD``. ``restart`` is the max number of stored update vectors.

Preconditioners
---------------

The following preconditioners, to be used with linear solvers, are available::

  gmm::identity_matrix P;   // No preconditioner

  gmm::diagonal_precond<matrix_type> P(SM); // diagonal preconditioner

  gmm::mr_approx_inverse_precond<matrix_type> P(SM, 10, 10E-17);
                                               // preconditioner based on MR
                                               // iterations

  gmm::ildlt_precond<matrix_type> P(SM); // incomplete (level 0) ldlt
                                        // preconditioner. Fast to be
                                        // computed but less efficient than
                                        // gmm::ildltt_precond.

  // incomplete ldlt with k fill-in and threshold preconditioner.
  // Efficient but could be costly.
  gmm::ildltt_precond<matrix_type> P(SM, k, threshold);

  gmm::ilu_precond<matrix_type> P(SM);  // incomplete (level 0) ilu
                                        // preconditioner. Very fast to be
                                        // computed but less efficient than
                                        // gmm::ilut_precond.


  // incomplete LU with k fill-in and threshold preconditioner.
  // Efficient but could be costly.
  gmm::ilut_precond<matrix_type> P(SM, k, threshold);

  // incomplete LU with k fill-in, threshold and column pivoting preconditioner.
  // Try it when ilut encounter too small pivots.
  gmm::ilutp_precond<matrix_type> P(SM, k, threshold);


Except ``ildltt\_precond``, all these precontionners come from ITL. ``ilut_precond`` has been optimized and simplified and ``cholesky_precond`` has been corrected and transformed in an incomplete LDLT preconditioner for stability reasons (similarly, we add ``choleskyt_precond`` which is in fact an incomplete LDLT with threshold preconditioner). Of course, ``ildlt\_precond`` and ``ildltt_precond`` are designed for symmetric real or hermitian complex matrices to be use principaly with cg.

Additive Schwarz method
-----------------------

The additive Schwarz method is a decomposition domain method allowing the resolution of huge linear systems (see [SCHADD]_ for the principle of the method).

For the moment, the method is not parallelized (this should be done ...). The call is the following::

 gmm::sequential_additive_schwarz(A, u, f, P, vB, iter, local_solver, global_solver)

``A`` is the matrix of the linear system. ``u`` is the unknown vector. ``f`` is the right hand side. ``P`` is an eventual preconditioner for the local solver. ``vB`` is a vector of rectangular sparse matrices (``of type const std::vector<vBMatrix>``, where ``vBMatrix`` is a sparse matrix type), each of these matrices is of size :math:`N \times N_i` where :math:`N` is the size of ``A`` and :math:`N_i` the number of variables in the :math:`i^{th}` sub-domain ; each column of the matrix is a base vector of the sub-space representing the :math:`i^{th}` sub-domain. ``iter`` is an iteration object. ``local_solver`` has to be chosen in the list ``gmm::using_gmres(), gmm::using_bicgstab(), gmm::using_cg(), gmm::using_qmr()`` and  ``gmm::using_superlu()`` if SuperLu is installed. ``global_solver`` has to be chosen in the list ``gmm::using_gmres(), gmm::using_bicgstab(), gmm::using_cg(), gmm::using_qmr()``.

The test program ``schwarz_additive.C`` is the directory ``tests`` of GetFEM++ is an example of the resolution with the additive Schwarz method of an elastostatic problem with the use of coarse mesh to make a better preconditioning (i.e. one of the sub-domains represents in fact a coarser mesh).

In the case of multiple solves with the same linear system, it is possible to store the preconditioners or the LU factorisations to save computation time.

A (too) simple program in ``gmm/gmm_domain_decomp.h`` allows to build a regular domain decomposition with a certain ratio of overlap. It directly produces the vector of matrices ``vB`` for the additive Schwarz method.

Range basis function
--------------------

The function ``gmm\_range\_basis(B, columns, EPS=1e-12)`` defined in ``gmm/gmm\_range\_basis.h`` allows to select from the columns of a sparse matrix ``B`` a basis of the range of this matrix. The result is returned in ``columns`` which should be of type ``std::set<size_type>`` and which contains the indices of the selected columns.

The algorithm is specially designed to select independent constraints from a large matrix with linearly dependent columns.

There is four step in the implemented algorithm


  - Elimination of null columns.
  - Selection of a set of already orthogonal columns.
  - Elimination of locally dependent columns by a blockwise Gram-Schmidt algorithm.
  - Computation of vectors of the remaining null space by a global restarted Lanczos algorithm and deduction of some columns to be eliminated.

The algorithm is efficient if after the local Gram-Schmidt algorithm it remains a low dimension null space. The implemented restarted Lanczos algorithm find the null space vectors one by one.

The Global restarted Lanczos algorithm may be improved or replaced by
a block Lanczos method (see [ca-re-so1994]_ for instance), a block
Wiedelann method (in order to be parallelized) or simply
the computation of more than one vector of the null space at each
iteration.
