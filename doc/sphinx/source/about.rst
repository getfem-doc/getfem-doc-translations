About these documents
=====================

These documents are generated from `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ sources by *Sphinx*, a
document processor specifically written for the Python documentation.

In the online version of these documents, you can submit comments and
suggest changes directly on the documentation pages.

Development of the documentation and its toolchain takes place on the
getfem-users@nongnu.org mailing list (see `getfem mailing lists <https://savannah.nongnu.org/mail/?group=getfem>`_ .  We're always looking for volunteers
wanting to help with the docs, so feel free to send a mail there!

Many thanks go to:

* Fred L. Drake, Jr., the creator of the original Python documentation
  toolset and writer of much of the content;
* The `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ project for creating
  reStructuredText and the Docutils suite;
* Fredrik Lundh for his `Alternative Python Reference
  <http://effbot.org/zone/pyref.htm>`_ project from which Sphinx got many
  good ideas.

See :ref:`reporting-bugs` for information how to report bugs in GetFEM++
itself.

It is only with the input and contributions of the GetFEM++ community
that GetFEM++ has such wonderful documentation -- Thank You!
